# Question 4

Consider a dataset of real values specified by the following variable in R:
$$x = c(0.2, 0.25, 0.1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.6, 0.61, 0.8)$$

Plot a histogram of the dataset such that the histogram has 4 equally sized bins spanning exactly the range of x. The bins must extend to the edges of the x-axis. The x-label must be indicated by x. The y-label must be indicated by the label Counts. The bins (aside from the first) must be right inclusive. (10 marks)

```{r}
x = c(0.2, 0.25, 0.1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.6, 0.61, 0.8)
hist(x,
     breaks = seq(from = min(x), to = max(x), length.out = 5),
     xlab = 'x',
     ylab = 'Counts')
```

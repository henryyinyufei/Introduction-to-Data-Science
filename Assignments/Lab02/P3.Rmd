# Question 3a, (2 points): 

Build an SQL query that joins both the 'zip' and the 'tickets' tables on the 'zip_code' field, and restricts the results to tickets where the fine_level1_amount is more than $100. What is the sum of the latitudes of all of the records in this query? 

Note that this sum should not include records for which the latitude is not recorded. 

```{r}
sql_qry = "SELECT * FROM zip
              INNER JOIN tickets ON
                zip.zip_code = tickets.zip_code
              WHERE 
                fine_level1_amount > 100"
join_zip_tickets = dbGetQuery(dbcon, sql_qry)
sum(join_zip_tickets$latitude, na.rm = TRUE)
```

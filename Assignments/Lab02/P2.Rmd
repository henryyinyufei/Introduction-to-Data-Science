# Question 2a, (3 points): 

Build a query that selects the city names, states and zipcodes from the `zip' for the state of Illinois. 

(Hint: Print the column names and then try to identify the exact column names before building the SQL query. You may need to figure out the 2 letter state code.) 

How many records are returned by this query?

```{r}
names(dbReadTable(dbcon, "zip"))
sql_qry = "SELECT zip_code, city, state FROM zip WHERE state == 'IL'"
dim(dbGetQuery(dbcon, sql_qry))[1]
```

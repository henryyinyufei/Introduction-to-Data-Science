# Question 4

* List three benefits of kmeans and three drawbacks.

\bigskip

## benefits

* Scales to large data sets.

* Easily adapts to new examples.

* Guarantees convergence

## drawbacks

* K-means chooses the initial centroid point randomly, and since the clustering accuracy depends on the initial choice of centroids, the accuracy can be low if the chosen centroids arenâ€™t proper.

* Considering only the distance between centroids of the cluster may not be efficient for categorical data.

* As the cluster size grows, it becomes a challenge to distinguish between two clusters based on a few attributes.

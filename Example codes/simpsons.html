        <meta name="description" content="FOX's landmark animated comedy began in December 1989 with the episode "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire," in which family patriarch Homer deals with a Christmas in which he's too poor to buy presents by adopting a canine from the local dog-racing track named Santa's Little Helper. While the show was a phenomenon almost from the get-go (with the face of 10-year-old hell-raiser and initial breakout character Bart Simpson appearing on just about every form of merchandise imaginable), few could have predicted then that "The Simpsons" would become a cultural institution, running for over two decades and defining the comedic sensibilities of a generation. In the first series, the animation was noticeably cruder and some of the voice actors were still figuring out their characters (Dan Castellaneta stated that he based Homer's voice in the early going on Walter Matthau), but the show still excelled at telling small-scale stories about a lower-middle-class family trying to get by: Homer gets fired from his job at the nuclear power plant and tries to get rehired, Bart deals with a bully and Lisa befriends a jazz saxophonist who helps cure her depression. In time, "The Simpsons" would evolve into nothing less than an elaborate satire of every aspect of American life in the late-20th century, with jokes that ranged from highbrow literary references to humor so stupid it was almost zen; here at the very beginning, it was simply an idiosyncratic show that was equal parts hilarious and heartwarming.">

In this episode, Bart gets a tattoo, and all of the family's Christmas money has to be used to surgically remove the tattoo from his arm. Not only was the family's savings drained, but Homer's Christmas bonus never materialized, so he's forced to take a job as a mall Santa to earn money for the holiday season.

Bart is as surprised as anyone when \"his\" test results confirm he has a genius IQ (while Martin is revealed to not be especially bright), and suddenly the school's staff decides Bart's rebellious behavior and previous poor grades were merely a product of boredom and dissatisfaction. Bart is transferred from Springfield Elementary to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, and he discovers his father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a new respect and admiration for him. But Bart finds life among the super-intelligent is rough sledding, and his brighter sister Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) has a hard time believing her brother is a genius. \"Bart the Genius\" was first aired on January 14, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":3,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e03","name":"Homer's Odyssey","description":"Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has never been one of the more distinguished employees at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but he reaches the last straw after a long series of accidents when he crashes an electric cart into a pipe full of radioactive waste -- just as his son Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is touring the plant with his class from school. Homer has no luck finding a new job, and falls into a deep depression; eventually, Homer decides to drown himself by jumping off a bridge, but when his family arrives at the last moment to save him, they're nearly hit by a speeding car. Deciding the intersection near the bridge is dangerous, Homer appears at a Springfield City Council meeting to demand a stop sign be installed; when the council agrees, Homer decides he's found a new purpose in life, and he becomes Springfield's leading safety crusader. Before long, Homer has become affiliated with People Against People for Nuclear Energy, a group looking to close down the Nuclear Power Plant for a number of safety violations. But Homer still needs a job, and he finds himself torn when the plant's owner Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) offers him a cushy, higher-paying job to shut him up. \"Homer's Odyssey\" was first aired on January 21, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":4,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e04","name":"There's No Disgrace like Home","description":"C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant -- and boss to Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) -- throws his annual employee picnic, which is hardly a relaxing experience for his workers, since he insists on winning all the games and tends to fire people who don't enjoy themselves. After observing the more highly functional families of his co-workers, Homer becomes depressed, convinced that the Simpsons are the worst family in Springfield. Determined to get his relationship with his wife and children back on track, Homer pawns the family's television and enrolls them all in group therapy with nationally advertised psychotherapist Dr. Marvin Monroe (voice of Shearer), who offers to give his patients double their money back if he can't resolve their issues. But Monroe soon realizes he's never been up against a challenge like treating the Simpsons. \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\" was first aired on January 28, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":5,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e05","name":"Bart the General","description":"Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) makes the mistake of trying to protect a batch of cupcakes Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) made for her teacher from schoolyard bully and thug in training Nelson (voice of Cartwright). Nelson gives Bart a beating, and promises more of the same; Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that Bart try to reason with the bully, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) tells his son that fighting dirty is the only answer. Neither strategy seems to work, so Bart turns to Grampa Simpson (voice of Castellaneta) for advice. With the help of Herman (voice of Harry Shearer), the mildly insane owner of a store specializing in military relics, Bart and Grampa organize his fellow fourth graders into an army and orchestrate an all-out water-balloon war against Nelson and his fellow bullies. \"Bart the General\" was first aired on February 4, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":6,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e06","name":"Moaning Lisa","description":"Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) is used to being a misfit, but one day she finds herself overcome by feelings of depression, and nothing she does seems to make her feel better. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is concerned, but can't seem to figure out what the matter is, and urges her daughter to ignore her feelings and put on a happy face. Lisa, however, makes friends with local jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy (voice of Ron Taylor), who shows her how to work out her bad feelings by playing the blues. Marge, however, isn't so sure that playing blues riffs will really help Lisa in the long run. Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has problems with Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), who has been subjecting Homer to a series of \"defeats -- correction, humiliating defeats\" on their video boxing game; Homer is convinced he has to start winning if he wants to regain the respect of his son. \"Moaning Lisa\" first aired on February 11, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":7,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e07","name":"Call of the Simpsons","description":"When his next-door neighbor Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer) rolls up with a fancy new mobile home, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) becomes jealous and decides he needs an RV of his own. However, given the dismal state of his credit rating, Homer has to settle for a used camper that's on its last legs. Undaunted, Homer rounds up the family and they set out for a camping trip; the Simpsons barely escape when the camper rolls over a cliff, and they find themselves forced to fend for themselves in the wilderness. Homer and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) volunteer to find civilization and come back to rescue Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), but a series of misadventures causes Homer to lose his clothing and he's soon captured by scientists convinced he's Bigfoot, while baby Maggie is adopted by a family of bears.

Bart decides to take in a showing of \"Space Mutants IV\" at the local movie house, but before he can buy his ticket, he runs into Jimbo, who offers to let Bart sneak in with him and his friends through the theater's rear exit. After spending the afternoon with Jimbo and his friends, Bart wants to do something to really impress his new pals; after joining them as they throw rocks at a statue of Jebediah Springfield, the town's founder, Bart thinks of a way to really show Jimbo he's tough -- he cuts off the statue's head. Soon it seems everyone in Springfield is up in arms about this act of vandalism -- including Jimbo, who informs Bart \"I'd never cut the head off a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands!\" Bart belatedly comes to the conclusion that he's gone too far, and owns up to the crime to his parents. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to help Bart return the head, but they run afoul of an angry mob protesting the desecration of the statue. \"The Telltale Head\" was first aired on February 25, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":9,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e09","name":"Life on the Fast Lane","description":"Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a reputation for not being very good at picking out gifts for his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), as evidenced by such past birthday presents as a tackle box and a Connie Chung calendar, but he hits a new low when Marge finds she's the recipient of a new bowling ball -- which has been drilled to fit Homer's hand and even has his name engraved on it. Marge is furious that Homer used her birthday as an excuse to get himself a gift, and while she doesn't bowl, she decides to learn just out of spite. Marge's early attempts to teach herself the game are disastrous, but she soon attracts the attention of Jacques (voice of Albert Brooks), a local professional bowler who has a French accent and a way with the ladies. Marge is more than flattered by the attention she's receiving from Jacques (who, just because he likes her, cuts his lesson fee from $50 to $25), and she begins spending more and more time with him. But when Jacques asks her to spend the afternoon at his apartment, she wonders if she ought to leave her marriage behind. Homer, Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) all suspect that something more than a friendly game of ten pins is going on between Marge and Jacques, and all react with different degrees of dread. \"Life on the Fast Lane\" first aired on March 18, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"},{"@type":"TVEpisode","episodeNumber":10,"url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons/s01/e10","name":"Homer's Night Out","description":"Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) informs his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) that he has to attend a party for a co-worker who is about to be married, but he reassures her it will be a subdued affair. With Homer out for the evening, Marge opts to take Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeadley Smith) out for dinner to The Rusty Barnacle, a local seafood restaurant -- not knowing that the bachelor party is being held in a banquet room at the same restaurant. Bart is poking around the restaurant with his new miniature camera when he stumbles into the party and sees Homer dancing with Princess Kashmir (voice of Maggie Roswell), an exotic dancer hired as entertainment. Bart snaps a few pictures of Homer and Princess Kashmir together, and gives a copy of one to his friend Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden); Milhouse begins making copies of the snapshot, and soon it seems everyone in Springfield has seen the picture. When Marge gets wind of this, she's understandably furious, not only because her husband lied to her, but for setting a bad example to Bart. Homer, seeking forgiveness, spends the evening trying to find Princess Kashmir with Bart in tow, hoping to show his son that the dancer is more than just a sexual object, but before long, Homer has taken his son on a tour of every strip joint in town. \"Homer's Night Out\" was first aired March 25, 1990.","datePublished":"1989-12-16"}],"genre":"Animation","image":[{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/sCMryrF3x22RCC8iEiw4EMoYYUA=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDsyNDc0NTU7ajsxODcwNTsxMjAwOzYwMDs0NTA"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/Ncse9_hhu08J-dzhl633Nv0uK1k=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDsxNjI1NDY7ajsxODcwNDsxMjAwOzU5NTsxMDc3"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/npU3cpnMb3FUdVm9wrsJ2TbDWkQ=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDsxMzE5ODY7ajsxODcwNDsxMjAwOzEyNzg7MTgxOA"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/8DiMCwUVFKAcMVytIQ8p2H_IV_I=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUxNDtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/Q8ChF6QV31SM-YuBOcvaa5euf4Y=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUxNTtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/3udzlAbwMO1Up4FPO_XwNQw3eWg=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUxNjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/JOtzmTdGdF3dprJOYMNpiHQgJ0w=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUxNztqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/LlQGmnTnvDK3NudXAnEWJaOAxW0=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUxOTtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/fWMm0saIjyUTG_ETlAbb_wKH9vg=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUyMDtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/ncU4vfeds_fktDhMRqZ5lSEkdSM=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUyMTtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/2wNv9t03rllmdN1rt2SL_gcEYD4=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUyMztqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://resizing.flixster.com/sY2JTzcXDDwfkUO90MySDWc4Nrw=/fit-in/1152x864/v1.dDs2NzUyNTtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4"}],"seasonNumber":1,"startDate":"1989-12-16","name":"The Simpsons: Season 1","partOfSeries":{"@type":"TVSeries","name":"The Simpsons","url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_simpsons","startDate":"1989-12-16"},"review":[{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"The citizens of Springfield deliver fresh stories, sharp barbs, and unique lessons on family, week in and week out - on a broadcast schedule, no less.","url":"https://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/best-animated-tv-shows-animation-simpsons-south-park-rick-morty-1201833828/4/","datePublished":"2018-07-04T17:00:00-07:00","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":1,"worstRating":-1,"ratingValue":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ben Travers"},"sourceOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"indieWire"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"...10 times funnier than The Flintstones...","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/from-the-archives/2017/12/18/flashback-simpsons-come-primetime-1989","datePublished":"2018-01-16T16:00:00-08:00","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":1,"worstRating":-1,"ratingValue":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ed Bark"},"sourceOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dallas Morning News"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"An endless, imponderable, unstoppable Niagara of sight gags, jokes, one-liners, characters and stories that explore everything from the meaning of God to the anti-allure of Duff Beer.","url":"http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-simpsons-marathon-12-days-of-magic-1.9098721","datePublished":"2014-08-19T17:00:00-07:00","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":1,"worstRating":-1,"ratingValue":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Verne Gay"},"sourceOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Newsday"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"In The Simpsons, warm and fuzzy family sitcoms are attacked with gleeful vigor.","url":"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/68682226/twin-peaks-season-one-the-simpsons/","datePublished":"2021-01-26T16:00:00-08:00","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":1,"worstRating":-1,"ratingValue":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Debi Enker"},"sourceOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Age (Australia)"}},{"@type":"Review","reviewBody":"But \"Simpsons\" fans have long been more Comic Book Guy than Troy McClure - so quality be damned;

                <p class="synopsis">The Simpsons Christmas Special is actually the first full-length episode of the popular animated television sitcom. In this episode, Bart gets a tattoo, and all of the family&#39;s Christmas money has to be used to surgically remove the tattoo from his arm. Not only was the family&#39;s savings drained, but Homer&#39;s Christmas bonus never materialized, so he&#39;s forced to take a job as a mall Santa to earn money for the holiday season. But Homer decides to spend the money at the racetrack, where he bets all of his salary on a greyhound called &quot;Santa&#39;s Little Helper&quot;.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Academics have never been a priority for Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright), and when Mrs. Krabappel (voice of Marcia Wallace) hands out a standardized IQ test that will &quot;merely determine your future social stature and financial success,&quot; Bart hedges his bets by swiping a test from class brain Martin Prince (voice of Russi Taylor) and putting his name on it. Bart is as surprised as anyone when &quot;his&quot; test results confirm he has a genius IQ (while Martin is revealed to not be especially bright), and suddenly the school&#39;s staff decides Bart&#39;s rebellious behavior and previous poor grades were merely a product of boredom and dissatisfaction. Bart is transferred from Springfield Elementary to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, and he discovers his father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a new respect and admiration for him. But Bart finds life among the super-intelligent is rough sledding, and his brighter sister Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) has a hard time believing her brother is a genius. &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; was first aired on January 14, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has never been one of the more distinguished employees at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but he reaches the last straw after a long series of accidents when he crashes an electric cart into a pipe full of radioactive waste -- just as his son Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is touring the plant with his class from school. Homer has no luck finding a new job, and falls into a deep depression; eventually, Homer decides to drown himself by jumping off a bridge, but when his family arrives at the last moment to save him, they&#39;re nearly hit by a speeding car. Deciding the intersection near the bridge is dangerous, Homer appears at a Springfield City Council meeting to demand a stop sign be installed; when the council agrees, Homer decides he&#39;s found a new purpose in life, and he becomes Springfield&#39;s leading safety crusader. Before long, Homer has become affiliated with People Against People for Nuclear Energy, a group looking to close down the Nuclear Power Plant for a number of safety violations. But Homer still needs a job, and he finds himself torn when the plant&#39;s owner Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) offers him a cushy, higher-paying job to shut him up. &quot;Homer&#39;s Odyssey&quot; was first aired on January 21, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant -- and boss to Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) -- throws his annual employee picnic, which is hardly a relaxing experience for his workers, since he insists on winning all the games and tends to fire people who don&#39;t enjoy themselves. After observing the more highly functional families of his co-workers, Homer becomes depressed, convinced that the Simpsons are the worst family in Springfield. Determined to get his relationship with his wife and children back on track, Homer pawns the family&#39;s television and enrolls them all in group therapy with nationally advertised psychotherapist Dr. Marvin Monroe (voice of Shearer), who offers to give his patients double their money back if he can&#39;t resolve their issues. But Monroe soon realizes he&#39;s never been up against a challenge like treating the Simpsons. &quot;There&#39;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; was first aired on January 28, 1990.</p>

Nelson gives Bart a beating, and promises more of the same; Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that Bart try to reason with the bully, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) tells his son that fighting dirty is the only answer. Neither strategy seems to work, so Bart turns to Grampa Simpson (voice of Castellaneta) for advice. With the help of Herman (voice of Harry Shearer), the mildly insane owner of a store specializing in military relics, Bart and Grampa organize his fellow fourth graders into an army and orchestrate an all-out water-balloon war against Nelson and his fellow bullies. &quot;Bart the General&quot; was first aired on February 4, 1990.</p>

Bart decides to take in a showing of &quot;Space Mutants IV&quot; at the local movie house, but before he can buy his ticket, he runs into Jimbo, who offers to let Bart sneak in with him and his friends through the theater&#39;s rear exit. After spending the afternoon with Jimbo and his friends, Bart wants to do something to really impress his new pals; after joining them as they throw rocks at a statue of Jebediah Springfield, the town&#39;s founder, Bart thinks of a way to really show Jimbo he&#39;s tough -- he cuts off the statue&#39;s head. Soon it seems everyone in Springfield is up in arms about this act of vandalism -- including Jimbo, who informs Bart &quot;I&#39;d never cut the head off a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands!&quot; Bart belatedly comes to the conclusion that he&#39;s gone too far, and owns up to the crime to his parents. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to help Bart return the head, but they run afoul of an angry mob protesting the desecration of the statue. &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; was first aired on February 25, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a reputation for not being very good at picking out gifts for his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), as evidenced by such past birthday presents as a tackle box and a Connie Chung calendar, but he hits a new low when Marge finds she&#39;s the recipient of a new bowling ball -- which has been drilled to fit Homer&#39;s hand and even has his name engraved on it. Marge is furious that Homer used her birthday as an excuse to get himself a gift, and while she doesn&#39;t bowl, she decides to learn just out of spite. Marge&#39;s early attempts to teach herself the game are disastrous, but she soon attracts the attention of Jacques (voice of Albert Brooks), a local professional bowler who has a French accent and a way with the ladies. Marge is more than flattered by the attention she&#39;s receiving from Jacques (who, just because he likes her, cuts his lesson fee from $50 to $25), and she begins spending more and more time with him. But when Jacques asks her to spend the afternoon at his apartment, she wonders if she ought to leave her marriage behind. Homer, Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) all suspect that something more than a friendly game of ten pins is going on between Marge and Jacques, and all react with different degrees of dread. &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot; first aired on March 18, 1990.</p>

With Homer out for the evening, Marge opts to take Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeadley Smith) out for dinner to The Rusty Barnacle, a local seafood restaurant -- not knowing that the bachelor party is being held in a banquet room at the same restaurant. Bart is poking around the restaurant with his new miniature camera when he stumbles into the party and sees Homer dancing with Princess Kashmir (voice of Maggie Roswell), an exotic dancer hired as entertainment. Bart snaps a few pictures of Homer and Princess Kashmir together, and gives a copy of one to his friend Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden); Milhouse begins making copies of the snapshot, and soon it seems everyone in Springfield has seen the picture. When Marge gets wind of this, she&#39;s understandably furious, not only because her husband lied to her, but for setting a bad example to Bart. Homer, seeking forgiveness, spends the evening trying to find Princess Kashmir with Bart in tow, hoping to show his son that the dancer is more than just a sexual object, but before long, Homer has taken his son on a tour of every strip joint in town. &quot;Homer&#39;s Night Out&quot; was first aired March 25, 1990.</p>

While the show was a phenomenon almost from the get-go (with the face of 10-year-old hell-raiser and initial breakout character Bart Simpson appearing on just about every form of merchandise imaginable), few could have predicted then that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would become a cultural institution, running for over two decades and defining the comedic sensibilities of a generation. In the first series, the animation was noticeably cruder and some of the voice actors were still figuring out their characters (Dan Castellaneta stated that he based Homer&#39;s voice in the early going on Walter Matthau), but the show still excelled at telling small-scale stories about a lower-middle-class family trying to get by: Homer gets fired from his job at the nuclear power plant and tries to get rehired, Bart deals with a bully and Lisa befriends a jazz saxophonist who helps cure her depression. In time, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would evolve into nothing less than an elaborate satire of every aspect of American life in the late-20th century, with jokes that ranged from highbrow literary references to humor so stupid it was almost zen; here at the very beginning, it was simply an idiosyncratic show that was equal parts hilarious and heartwarming.

In this episode, Bart gets a tattoo, and all of the family&#39;s Christmas money has to be used to surgically remove the tattoo from his arm. Not only was the family&#39;s savings drained, but Homer&#39;s Christmas bonus never materialized, so he&#39;s forced to take a job as a mall Santa to earn money for the holiday season. But Homer decides to spend the money at the racetrack, where he bets all of his salary on a greyhound called &quot;Santa&#39;s Little Helper&quot;.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Academics have never been a priority for Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright), and when Mrs. Krabappel (voice of Marcia Wallace) hands out a standardized IQ test that will &quot;merely determine your future social stature and financial success,&quot; Bart hedges his bets by swiping a test from class brain Martin Prince (voice of Russi Taylor) and putting his name on it. Bart is as surprised as anyone when &quot;his&quot; test results confirm he has a genius IQ (while Martin is revealed to not be especially bright), and suddenly the school&#39;s staff decides Bart&#39;s rebellious behavior and previous poor grades were merely a product of boredom and dissatisfaction. Bart is transferred from Springfield Elementary to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, and he discovers his father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a new respect and admiration for him. But Bart finds life among the super-intelligent is rough sledding, and his brighter sister Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) has a hard time believing her brother is a genius. &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; was first aired on January 14, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has never been one of the more distinguished employees at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but he reaches the last straw after a long series of accidents when he crashes an electric cart into a pipe full of radioactive waste -- just as his son Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is touring the plant with his class from school. Homer has no luck finding a new job, and falls into a deep depression; eventually, Homer decides to drown himself by jumping off a bridge, but when his family arrives at the last moment to save him, they&#39;re nearly hit by a speeding car. Deciding the intersection near the bridge is dangerous, Homer appears at a Springfield City Council meeting to demand a stop sign be installed; when the council agrees, Homer decides he&#39;s found a new purpose in life, and he becomes Springfield&#39;s leading safety crusader. Before long, Homer has become affiliated with People Against People for Nuclear Energy, a group looking to close down the Nuclear Power Plant for a number of safety violations. But Homer still needs a job, and he finds himself torn when the plant&#39;s owner Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) offers him a cushy, higher-paying job to shut him up. &quot;Homer&#39;s Odyssey&quot; was first aired on January 21, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant -- and boss to Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) -- throws his annual employee picnic, which is hardly a relaxing experience for his workers, since he insists on winning all the games and tends to fire people who don&#39;t enjoy themselves. After observing the more highly functional families of his co-workers, Homer becomes depressed, convinced that the Simpsons are the worst family in Springfield. Determined to get his relationship with his wife and children back on track, Homer pawns the family&#39;s television and enrolls them all in group therapy with nationally advertised psychotherapist Dr. Marvin Monroe (voice of Shearer), who offers to give his patients double their money back if he can&#39;t resolve their issues. But Monroe soon realizes he&#39;s never been up against a challenge like treating the Simpsons. &quot;There&#39;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; was first aired on January 28, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) makes the mistake of trying to protect a batch of cupcakes Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) made for her teacher from schoolyard bully and thug in training Nelson (voice of Cartwright). Nelson gives Bart a beating, and promises more of the same; Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that Bart try to reason with the bully, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) tells his son that fighting dirty is the only answer. Neither strategy seems to work, so Bart turns to Grampa Simpson (voice of Castellaneta) for advice. With the help of Herman (voice of Harry Shearer), the mildly insane owner of a store specializing in military relics, Bart and Grampa organize his fellow fourth graders into an army and orchestrate an all-out water-balloon war against Nelson and his fellow bullies. &quot;Bart the General&quot; was first aired on February 4, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) is used to being a misfit, but one day she finds herself overcome by feelings of depression, and nothing she does seems to make her feel better. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is concerned, but can&#39;t seem to figure out what the matter is, and urges her daughter to ignore her feelings and put on a happy face. Lisa, however, makes friends with local jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy (voice of Ron Taylor), who shows her how to work out her bad feelings by playing the blues. Marge, however, isn&#39;t so sure that playing blues riffs will really help Lisa in the long run. Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has problems with Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), who has been subjecting Homer to a series of &quot;defeats -- correction, humiliating defeats&quot; on their video boxing game; Homer is convinced he has to start winning if he wants to regain the respect of his son. &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; first aired on February 11, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">When his next-door neighbor Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer) rolls up with a fancy new mobile home, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) becomes jealous and decides he needs an RV of his own. However, given the dismal state of his credit rating, Homer has to settle for a used camper that&#39;s on its last legs. Undaunted, Homer rounds up the family and they set out for a camping trip; the Simpsons barely escape when the camper rolls over a cliff, and they find themselves forced to fend for themselves in the wilderness. Homer and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) volunteer to find civilization and come back to rescue Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), but a series of misadventures causes Homer to lose his clothing and he&#39;s soon captured by scientists convinced he&#39;s Bigfoot, while baby Maggie is adopted by a family of bears. Albert Brooks makes a guest appearance as the voice of Bob, the RV salesman. &quot;The Call of the Simpson&quot; was first aired on February 18, 1990.</p>

Bart decides to take in a showing of &quot;Space Mutants IV&quot; at the local movie house, but before he can buy his ticket, he runs into Jimbo, who offers to let Bart sneak in with him and his friends through the theater&#39;s rear exit. After spending the afternoon with Jimbo and his friends, Bart wants to do something to really impress his new pals; after joining them as they throw rocks at a statue of Jebediah Springfield, the town&#39;s founder, Bart thinks of a way to really show Jimbo he&#39;s tough -- he cuts off the statue&#39;s head. Soon it seems everyone in Springfield is up in arms about this act of vandalism -- including Jimbo, who informs Bart &quot;I&#39;d never cut the head off a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands!&quot; Bart belatedly comes to the conclusion that he&#39;s gone too far, and owns up to the crime to his parents. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to help Bart return the head, but they run afoul of an angry mob protesting the desecration of the statue. &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; was first aired on February 25, 1990.</p>

                <p class="synopsis">Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a reputation for not being very good at picking out gifts for his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), as evidenced by such past birthday presents as a tackle box and a Connie Chung calendar, but he hits a new low when Marge finds she&#39;s the recipient of a new bowling ball -- which has been drilled to fit Homer&#39;s hand and even has his name engraved on it. Marge is furious that Homer used her birthday as an excuse to get himself a gift, and while she doesn&#39;t bowl, she decides to learn just out of spite. Marge&#39;s early attempts to teach herself the game are disastrous, but she soon attracts the attention of Jacques (voice of Albert Brooks), a local professional bowler who has a French accent and a way with the ladies. Marge is more than flattered by the attention she&#39;s receiving from Jacques (who, just because he likes her, cuts his lesson fee from $50 to $25), and she begins spending more and more time with him. But when Jacques asks her to spend the afternoon at his apartment, she wonders if she ought to leave her marriage behind. Homer, Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) all suspect that something more than a friendly game of ten pins is going on between Marge and Jacques, and all react with different degrees of dread. &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot; first aired on March 18, 1990.</p>

With Homer out for the evening, Marge opts to take Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeadley Smith) out for dinner to The Rusty Barnacle, a local seafood restaurant -- not knowing that the bachelor party is being held in a banquet room at the same restaurant. Bart is poking around the restaurant with his new miniature camera when he stumbles into the party and sees Homer dancing with Princess Kashmir (voice of Maggie Roswell), an exotic dancer hired as entertainment. Bart snaps a few pictures of Homer and Princess Kashmir together, and gives a copy of one to his friend Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden); Milhouse begins making copies of the snapshot, and soon it seems everyone in Springfield has seen the picture. When Marge gets wind of this, she&#39;s understandably furious, not only because her husband lied to her, but for setting a bad example to Bart. Homer, seeking forgiveness, spends the evening trying to find Princess Kashmir with Bart in tow, hoping to show his son that the dancer is more than just a sexual object, but before long, Homer has taken his son on a tour of every strip joint in town. &quot;Homer&#39;s Night Out&quot; was first aired March 25, 1990.</p>

It&#39;s had crossovers with Family Guy, The Critic and Futurama.
Clever humor and writing.
Good voice acting.
Likable and memorable characters, especially Homer and Bart Simpson.
Each of the family members has a very distinct personality.
Homer is the dimwitted, but well-meaning dad.
Marge is the strict, but loving mother.
Bart is the trouble-making son.
Lisa is the overachieving daughter.
Maggie is the silent member of the family.
There are so many hilarious and unforgettable running gags.
Sideshow Bob repeatedly trying to kill Bart Simpson after the events of &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;.
A different kind of couch gag at the beginning of every episode.
Homer Simpson&#39;s famous and signature catchphrase: &quot;D&#39;oh!&quot;.
The way Superintendent Chalmers says &quot;Skinner!&quot;.
Itchy &amp; Scratchy, which parodies the violent cartoons of the early-to-mid 20th century.
Nelson Muntz&#39;s famous laugh.
Memorable opening theme music, composed by Danny Elfman and arranged by Alf Clausen.
It&#39;s sophisticated and generous in its humor.
Gives out a lot of good morals and lessons for viewers of all ages, like &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot;.
The episodes where The Simpsons travel around the world to other countries and other US states are great (except for &quot;Kill the Alligator and Run&quot;).
Loads of hilarious moments, funny couch gags, great stories and relatable pop-culture references like references to Dr. Seuss, South Park, Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus, Scooby-Doo, The Beatles, Nintendo, Looney Tunes, SpongeBob SquarePants, Michael Jackson, Marvel, etc.
The &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; specials are funny, terrifying and unforgettable at the same time.
Gives us decent facts and real-life events about celebrities, politicians, etc.
Many supporting side characters (Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, Ned Flanders, Moe Szyslak, Krusty the Clown, Milhouse van Houten, Chief Wiggum etc.)
It also has its share of many entertaining antagonists (Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob, Frank Grimes, Hank Scorpio, Kang and Kodos).
The series was so popular that it had its own film adaptation in 2007, which is also well-received.
Unlike most FOX shows, The Simpsons takes aim at both the Democratic and Republican parties, depicting Republicans as corrupt warmongers and Democrats as brainless idiots. (and the opposite, indeed!) Not even presidents were safe from criticism, as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton have all been subjected to mockery on the show.
The Simpsons has many famous celebrity guest stars in their episodes (Ringo Starr, Barry White, George Carlin, Leonard Nimoy, Mark Hamill, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Jackson, Alec Baldwin, etc).</div>

While the show was a phenomenon almost from the get-go (with the face of 10-year-old hell-raiser and initial breakout character Bart Simpson appearing on just about every form of merchandise imaginable), few could have predicted then that \"The Simpsons\" would become a cultural institution, running for over two decades and defining the comedic sensibilities of a generation. In the first series, the animation was noticeably cruder and some of the voice actors were still figuring out their characters (Dan Castellaneta stated that he based Homer's voice in the early going on Walter Matthau), but the show still excelled at telling small-scale stories about a lower-middle-class family trying to get by: Homer gets fired from his job at the nuclear power plant and tries to get rehired, Bart deals with a bully and Lisa befriends a jazz saxophonist who helps cure her depression. In time, \"The Simpsons\" would evolve into nothing less than an elaborate satire of every aspect of American life in the late-20th century, with jokes that ranged from highbrow literary references to humor so stupid it was almost zen; here at the very beginning, it was simply an idiosyncratic show that was equal parts hilarious and heartwarming.","audienceReviews":[{"id":"1466","type":"tvAudienceReview","score":3.5,"firstName":"Dann","lastName":"Michalski","elite":true,"ratingDate":"2013-11-15T16:00:00-08:00","comment":"The groundbreaking animated family comedy The Simpsons delivers a hilarious first season. The animation style is a little crude and the character designs fluctuate a bit, but overall the series has an interesting look and feel to it. And, the comedy is especially sharp; using a lot of satire and parody. Additionally, the show does an impressive job at world building and at setting up a vast array of supporting characters. Also, several guest stars including Kelsey Grammer and Penny Marshall are featured. Season 1 of The Simpsons is a lot of fun and is full of laughs.","mediaType":"TV

Simpson on Matt Groening and James L. Brooks' long, long-running Fox animated sitcom The Simpsons, Dan Castellaneta is well-reputed for his modest, unassuming presence in real life and his paradoxical ability to spin characters -- seemingly from out of nowhere -- that instantly take on lives of their own. Groening once famously remarked that \"Dan can do everything, and he practically does....You might never notice him, but then he opens his mouth and he completely creates one character after another.'' Born in 1957, Castellaneta grew up in the small town of Oak Grove, IL, in the northwestern corner of the state, near the Iowa border. As a self-described introvert who developed and honed a facility for slipping into the guise of characters to entertain and make social situations easier (read: class clown), Castellaneta nevertheless diverged from this path in college and worked toward a career as a high-school art teacher via his studies at Northern Illinois University. Then, one of Castellaneta's professors (perhaps sensing some dissatisfaction) wisely admonished him to only work at a field, and in a job, that he loved. Castellaneta reasoned that acting fit the bill, and auditioned for the infamous sketch comedy troupe Second City shortly after graduation. The troupe hired him, and in time, the skills that the actor projected led to his involvement on the then-fledgling Fox network's sketch comedy series The Tracey Ullman Show, which premiered on Sunday, April 5, 1987. Castellaneta joined Ullman, Julie Kavner, Joe Malone, Sam McMurray, and for a time Anna Levine in live-action skits that parodied all aspects of Western culture.As a most unusual aspect of her program, Ullman opted to feature crudely animated, offbeat segments as Monty Python-style transitions between the individual sketches. The episodes in question were drawn by Gabor Csupo and Groening (at that time, comic-strip artist of growing infamy known for his Life Is Hell series starring a buck-toothed, bug-eyed rabbit named Bucky). Although the subjects of the shorts initially varied, within a few months they began to focus exclusively on a hyper-dysfunctional blue-collar family called the Simpsons; Kavner and Castellaneta voiced parents Homer and Marge Simpson, respectively. Those segments gained such massive popularity that they eventually outshone that of the Ullman show itself (which wrapped in September 1990), and executive producer James L. Brooks, following this cue, decided to spin off the Simpsons into their own weekly animated series. Kavner and Castellaneta, of course, followed Brooks to the new program, joined in time by longtime Brooks acquaintance Harry Shearer, as well as Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and numerous others.The Simpsons premiered on Fox on December 17, 1989, and became not simply a hit but a phenomenon. It shot up to instantly become one of the highest-rated series on television, and attained iconic status. The program scored as a cause célèbre not simply with children (as expected) but with adult viewers as well, who appreciated the show's ability to skewer all aspects of society and culture.

The decision was made to create a new character: Rhoda's pudgy, insecure younger sister, Brenda. The actress chosen for the role sounded as though she'd been a New Yorker since the womb, but in fact Julie Kavner was born and raised in California. A theatre student at USC-San Francisco, Kavner came to Rhoda with no professional experience, but before the series ran its course, she had won an Emmy for her portrayal. With her performance in the 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters, Kavner became one of the most prominent members of director Woody Allen's stock company, essaying very un-Brendalike roles in Radio Days (1987), the \"Oedipus Wrecks\" segment of New York Stories (1989), Alice (1990) and Shadows and Fog (1992). Kavner's regular stint as an ensemble player on the Fox TV network's Tracy Ullman Show led to her long-running assignment as the gravelly voice of Marge Simpson on the weekly animated series The Simpsons. Even as she continued to work on The Simpsons for the nex twenty years, she would make occasional big-screen appearances in projects as diverse as I'll Do Anything, Forget Paris, Judy Berlin, and Click.She also maintained an ongoing working relationship with Woody Allen appearing in Deconstructing Harry and in the 1994 made-for TV adaptation of the famous director's play Don't Drink the Water.","vanity":"julie_kavner"}},{"id":"1066684","type":"movieCast","characters":["Bart Simpson\u002FNelson Muntz\u002FTodd Flanders\u002FRalph Wiggum\u002FKearney"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"406923407","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-786561","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODY1NjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzQwMDs2MDA","height":600,"width":400,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FmxXoHAD24CqODhvuEfZ3UTW6kqU=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODY1NjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzQwMDs2MDA"},"name":"Nancy Cartwright","bio":"Eternally known as the voice of Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright is one of the most prolific voice actors of her time. Born in an Ohio suburb in the late '50s, she grew up doing community theater and watching cartoons. In her last year at Ohio University, she got a chance to meet Hanna-Barbara voice actor Daws Butler. Better known by his character names Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, and Quick Draw McGraw, Butler suggested she transfer to U.C.L.A. and start going to auditions. By 1980, Cartwright had her first professional job as the voice of Gloria on Richie Rich. With her new Screen Actors Guild card, she also got normal acting roles on the TV movie Marian Rose White, the feature film Twilight Zone: The Movie, and several television guest appearances. Her voice was heard as multiple characters on beloved '80s cartoons like My Little Pony & Friends, Pound Puppies, Space Ace, and Galaxy High School. Eventually Cartwright started to get singular roles like Kip on ShirtTales and Daphne on Snorks. In 1987, she auditioned for the role of Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons but she landed the role of Bart instead. After a few years of shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons got its own time slot on FOX in 1990. Cartwright won an Emmy and an Annie award for her work, which has expanded to several other Springfield youths including Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, Milhouse, Kearney, and Nelson. While still working on The Simpsons, she also did voices for Animaniacs, Goof Troop, and The Critic, as well as numerous short-lived cartoons (remember God, the Devil and Bob?). Cartwright has also found time to perform the one-woman play In Search of Fellini and write her autobiography My Life as a Ten-Year-Old Boy. In 2001 she took over for Christine Cavanaugh in the role of Chuckie on Rugrats while working on Kim Possible and launching her Internet animation company, SportsBlast. Her voice can also be heard on the web cartoons The Kellys and Timberwolf.Cartwright would continue to remain an extremely active force in the world of voice acting over the coming years, most notably on series like All Grown Up, The Replacements, and Betsy's Kindergarten Adventures.","vanity":"nancy_cartwright"}},{"id":"1066685","type":"movieCast","characters":["Lisa Simpson"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"408823130","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-786321","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODYzMjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FvUmJUrTPoKQQgr8cg22EUtFT6hs=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODYzMjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Yeardley Smith","bio":"Yeardley Smith is unarguably the keeper of one of Hollywood's most distinctive-sounding and instantly recognizable set of vocal chords; the Emmy-winning actress' most famous role is without question that of level-headed, suburban schoolgirl Lisa Simpson on the long-running animated television series The Simpsons. Though most of her live-action roles would come during the mid-'80s with such guilty pleasures as The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive, Smith remained active in front of the camera well into the new millennium with roles in such features as As Good As It Gets and such popular television series as Dharma & Greg. Born in Paris, France, Smith kicked off her acting career at Washington, D.C.'s Arena Stage before making the move to Broadway in Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing in 1984. A role in the after-school special Mom's on Strike marked the actress' first foray into television, and after graduating to features with a supporting role in the 1985 comedy Heaven Help Us, she gained notable exposure later that same year in the teen drama The Legend of Billie Jean. If the film failed to live up to the hype, Smith's performance (as a somewhat shy teen who discovers her own self-confidence after joining a teenage outlaw on the road) offered a scene-stealing turn that would overflow into the following year's much-maligned horror film Maximum Overdrive. A small supporting role in the 1987 teen comedy Three O'Clock High was quick to follow, and that same year, Smith would step behind the microphone for the role that would change her life. Originally conceived as a series of shorts made to run during The Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons proved so popular that it was soon given its very own series. Beginning in 1989, The Simpsons quickly became nothing less than a cultural phenomenon, with brother Bart's rebellious antics quickly making \"Don't have a cow, man\" the national catch phrase. As popular as the series was initially, few could have foreseen that it would go on to surpass The Flintstones as the longest-running animated prime-time series in the history of television. In the years that followed, Lisa would move to the forefront in many episodes, endearing her to a nation of television viewers. Though Smith would still make the occasional foray into features, with bit roles in City Slickers, Toys, Just Write, and As Good As It Gets, it was her role on The Simpsons that kept her busy throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium.Aside from voicing Lisa Simpson she didn't appear on-screen in the first decade of the 21st century, but she returned with bit parts in movies like HIGH School and New Year's Eve in 2010 and 2011.","vanity":"yeardley_smith"}},{"id":"1066686","type":"movieCast","characters":["Mr. Burns\u002FLenny\u002FNed Flanders\u002FSeymour Skinner\u002FWaylon Smithers"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"162658996","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-796325","thumborId":"v1.bjs3OTYzMjU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FnbwZHXGz8eXh4W1HzBQyjN7I2J4=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3OTYzMjU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Harry Shearer","bio":"California native Harry Shearer was one of the busier child actors of the 1950s.

After attending U.C.L.A., Shearer flourished as a standup comedian and comedy writer. He was frequently employed on the writing staff for such TV laughspinners as Laverne and Shirley and America 2Night; he also worked both sides of the camera in the 1984 rockumentary parody This Is Spinal Tap, co-starring as rock idol Derek Smalls and co-writing the script with director Rob Reiner and fellow cast members Christopher Guest and Michael McKean. In league with another top satirist, Albert Brooks, Shearer concocted the screenplay for another faux documentary, 1979's Real Lampoon. During the 1984-1985 TV season, Shearer joined the Not Ready for Prime Time Players on NBC's Saturday Night Live.

Azaria scored his breakthrough in 1989 when he began providing a multitude of voices for the Fox network's groundbreaking animated series The Simpsons, an assignment that imparted the performer with an enviable degree of cult stardom. In 1991, Azaria nabbed a major role in the Fox live-action sitcom Herman's Head, which ran until 1994 and gave audiences a glimpse of the man responsible for the vocal intonations of some of the most famous characters to ever corrupt an animator's storyboard.A native of Queens, NY, where he was born into a family of Sephardic Jews on April 25, 1964, Azaria commenced film roles in the late 1980s, coincident with his Simpsons stardom. Work on that program (which, after graduating from a series of crude sketches on The Tracey Ullmann Show to its own animated sitcom, quickly shot up to qualify as the Fox network's most popular enterprise) easily outstripped Azaria's screen work in popularity and visibility for many years. Recurring parts included Indian convenience store owner Apu, quack doctor Nick Riviera, dim-witted bartender Moe, and the idiotic, pig-nosed Springfield Chief of Police, Clancy Wiggum. Though his Simpsons work continued unabated over the years, beginning in the mid-1990s Azaria branched out somewhat, placing a heavier emphasis on live-action portrayals. Even in that venue, however, his work tonally mirrored his animated contributions; he specialized in adroitly handling goofy, over-the-top character parts, often with an ethnic bent. The performer attained visibility and memorability, for example, as the klutzy and scantily-dressed gay houseboy Agador in The Birdcage (1995), Hector, a goofy Hispanic paramour with a permanent effeminate lisp, in Joe Roth's underrated showbiz comedy America's Sweethearts (2001), and Claude, a Gallic beach bum with no qualms about taking off with other men's wives, in John Hamburg's gross-out romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004).Azaria has also departed from the boundaries of screen comedy from time to time, doing memorable work across genre lines in such films as Great Expectations (1998) (which cast him as Gwyneth Paltrow's lackluster fiancé), Mystery Men (1999) (as the superhero Blue Raja), and Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock (1999), a historical drama about art and politics in 1930s New York that cast Azaria as leftist playwright Marc Blitzstein. In 2005, Azaria presided as one of the many off-color monologuists in Penn Jillette's stand-up comedy showcase film The Aristocrats; the performer subsequently provided at least seventeen voices (including his usual series roles) for The Simpsons Movie (2007) and voiced both Abbie Hoffmann and Allen Ginsberg in the animated sequences of Brett Morgen's offbeat documentary Chicago 10 (2007).He appeared in the pre-historic comedy Year One, and provided several voices in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He played an ethically challenged doctor in Love and Other Drugs, and portrayed Gargamel, the bad guy in the big-screen hit The Smurfs. He was in family film Hop, and lent his prodigious vocal talents to Happy Feet Two. In 2012 he acted in the biopic Lovelace.In July 1999, Azaria married actress Helen Hunt, with whom he co-starred in several episodes of the sitcom Mad About You. The two divorced within eighteen months.","vanity":"hank_azaria"}},{"id":"1066687","type":"movieCast","characters":["Milhouse Van Houten\u002FRod Flanders"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770708084","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-1230686","thumborId":"v1.bjsxMjMwNjg2O2o7MTg3MTY7MTIwMDs0ODU7NDc2","height":476,"width":485,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FR3PG99iZJpHED-WiNJeVNf3nrMg=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjsxMjMwNjg2O2o7MTg3MTY7MTIwMDs0ODU7NDc2"},"name":"Pamela Hayden","bio":"","vanity":"pamela_hayden"}},{"id":"1066665","type":"movieCast","characters":["Edna Krabappel"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770752922","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-781346","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODEzNDY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FonwjgaQT6WDyqTshFFeBf9XRLd4=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODEzNDY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Marcia Wallace","bio":"Actress and comedian Marcia Wallace began her career as a stage actress, appearing with the improv troupe The Fourth Wall and in off-Broadway plays in the late '60s.

The son of comedian Harry Einstein (better known to millions of radio fans as Parkyakarkus), Brooks briefly attended Carnegie Tech before launching a hills-and-valley career as a standup comic. Like such contemporaries as George Carlin and Robert Klein, Brooks delighted in finding humor in the inconsistencies of everyday life, and had a particular fondness for exploiting clichés that many people never realized were clichés. Two of his most fondly remembered routines involved a talking mime and a ritualistic recital of the ingredients in a carton of Cool-Whip. After appearing as a regular on the 1969-1970 season of The Dean Martin Show (as well as its 1971 spin-off The Golddiggers), Brooks gained instant pop-culture fame for his brilliant short-subject directorial debut, The Famous Comedian's School, which was highlighted on a 1971 installment of The Great American Dream Machine. Even today, comedy buffs can cite from memory the particulars of \"The Danny Thomas\u002FSid Melton School of Coffee-Spitting.\" In 1975, Brooks won a Grammy for his album A Star Is Bought; that same year, he began filming short sketches for Saturday Night Live. Though often the highlights of that series' first season, Brooks' skits were dropped from SNL because they were considered \"too inside.\" Brooks made his theatrical film debut in 1976, playing Cybill Shepherd's clueless co-worker in Taxi Driver. His subsequent film roles included the first husband of Goldie Hawn in Private Benjamin (1980), Dudley Moore's cuckolded manager in Unfaithfully Yours (1984), and, best of all, his Oscar-nominated turn as the acerbic, freely perspiring TV journalist Aaron Altman in Broadcast News (1987). Even more impressive have been Brooks' credits as writer\u002Fdirector, including the PBS-documentary lampoon Real Life (1979), the angst-driven Modern Romance (1981), the yuppie odyssey Lost in America (1985), and the \"Heaven is a Strip Mall\" fantasy Defending Your Life (1991). In 1994, Brooks both wrote and acted in the darkly humorous baseball film The Scout. In 1996, he directed, wrote, and starred opposite Debbie Reynolds (making her first screen appearance in over two decades) in Mother. After taking some time off from directing and scriptwriting to appear in such films as Out of Sight (1998), Brooks resumed his director-screenwriter-actor hyphenate with The Muse (1999), starring opposite Andie MacDowell and Sharon Stone as a struggling Hollywood scriptwriter in search of divine inspiration; Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World followed in 2005.Unarguably, Brooks's highest-profile performance came not in one of his directorial projects, but in the 2003 Pixar underwater adventure Finding Nemo. Lending his voice to the film's lead clown-fish, the critically-acclaimed picture went on to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time and also featured the talents of Ellen Degeneres and Willem Dafoe.He became part of the cast of the Showtime series Weeds as the main character's former father-in-law. 2011 turned out to be an excellent year for the revered performer. That year saw publication of his first novel, 2030, a comedy about the future of America. He also played the part of Bernie Rose, the bad guy in the hotly buzzed about action film Drive. Though he captured numerous year-end critics prizes, Brooks was denied an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.","vanity":"albert_brooks"}},{"id":"1725926","type":"movieCast","characters":["Adil"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"770683981","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-783015","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODMwMTU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzM5Mjs0MjE","height":421,"width":392,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fg4s781Q1phrBsqrvgajcWzdj6do=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODMwMTU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzM5Mjs0MjE"},"name":"Tress MacNeille","bio":"","vanity":"tress_macneille"}},{"id":"1066723","type":"movieCast","characters":["Weasel #1"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"408746708","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-788732","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODg3MzI7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FPPCmj3QZbnPRhYGPW0Rm51wDFqU=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODg3MzI7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Susan Blu","bio":"","vanity":"susan_blu"}},{"id":"1066759","type":"movieCast","characters":["SNPP Employee\u002FDuff Commercial VO"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770683355","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-794056","thumborId":"v1.bjs3OTQwNTY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzUzMzs4MDA","height":800,"width":533,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FsssrzkNhBOEvuSHkZ8n3wJzq7G8=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3OTQwNTY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzUzMzs4MDA"},"name":"Sam McMurray","bio":"Dark-haired character actor Sam McMurray has made a career of playing gaseous windbags of low moral fiber, often adding a salacious sneer to heighten the effect. However, his comic persona also sometimes slants toward lovable obliviousness, making McMurray a desired commodity in broad comedy, as well as a sitcom mainstay.The New York native got his start in acting with bit parts on television and in the movies in the late '70s and early '80s. In 1987, McMurray had a breakout year of sorts, appearing as a regular on The Tracey Ullman Show (which led to vocal work in the early seasons of The Simpsons) and snagging the film role for which he is best known. In Joel and Ethan Coen's Raising Arizona, McMurray was cast as Glen, Nicolas Cage's factory foreman boss, who runs afoul of Cage's H.I. McDonnough after he proposes swapping wives. In only a handful of scenes, McMurray creates an indelible and hilarious image of a loud, crass, humor-impaired buffoon who resides over a brood of ill-mannered children, but wants to add at least one more to the mix.Raising Arizona paved the way for supporting work in a number of high-profile comedies in the ensuing years, including National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), L.A. Story (1991), and Addams Family Values (1993). In 1991, he voiced a character in the Disney\u002FABC live-action TV show Dinosaurs; he would later also provide vocal work for the animated Disney program Recess (1997). Television has provided McMurray with his most regular paychecks, most often in the capacity of a guest performer, both in dramas and sitcoms.

A New York native (born Carole Penny Marsciarelli), Marshall is the daughter of an industrial filmmaker and a dance instructor. She started dancing herself as a toddler and as a teen competed on The Ted Mack Amateur Hour with a dance troupe comprised of several friends. The group also appeared on The Jackie Gleason Show. By the time she was a young adult and had graduated with degrees in math and psychology from the University of New Mexico, her older brother, Garry Marshall, had established himself as a successful television writer. It was Garry who provided Marshall with her first film role in his feature film debut effort as a screenwriter and producer in How Sweet It Is (1968).When her brother began creating and producing situation comedies, he made sure Marshall had parts in his shows, the first of which was My Friend Tony and the second was The Odd Couple, where she had a recurring role. Marshall also guest starred on other comedies, including The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but her big break didn't come until her brother cast her and her friend Cindy Williams as Laverne and Shirley in an episode of his popular series Happy Days. Her portrayal of a wiseacre working-class broad and Williams' take on the more innocent Shirley gained an instant fan base and so Garry Marshall was inspired to build a sitcom around the characters. Laverne and Shirley debuted in 1978 and ran through 1983. During this period, Marshall was married to actor-turned-director Rob Reiner. She divorced him in the early '80s. At that time, it was apparent that her acting career was on a dead-end street and Marshall decided to try out directing. Beginning with television movies and series such as The Tracey Ullman Show, Marshall learned to direct. She made her feature film directorial debut with the Whoopi Goldberg vehicle Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986) which had originally been slated for director Howard Zieff. Returning her brother's favors, she gave him a part in the film and also created a part for her daughter, Tracy Reiner (the offspring from Marshall's first marriage to Michael Henry). The film was a critical and box-office dud, but this did not deter Marshall from trying again. Her second attempt at directing, Big (1988), the story of a boy whose wish is granted and so finds himself stranded in a man's body, made actor Tom Hanks a movie star and established Marshall as a respectable big-league filmmaker. Still, she took two years to finish her next film, Awakenings (1990). This was due in part to 20th Century Fox's reluctance to have the story filmed until Marshall had engaged her friends Robin Williams, in a rare subdued dramatic role, and Robert De Niro. A well-made and poignant drama, Awakenings received three Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. For her next film, Marshall offered up a sentimental, funny, and ebullient look at the women who kept professional baseball alive when all the young men were off fighting during WWII in A League of Their Own (1992). It was a well-crafted effort that has grown in popularity on video and netted star Geena Davis a Golden Globe nomination. Since then, Marshall's directorial output yielded uneven results and her films, while still loaded with mainstream appeal, had yet to reach the degree of popularity of her earlier work. In the late '90s, she and her much-younger pal, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, became popular for a series of television commercials for K-Mart. In addition to directing and producing, Marshall occasionally continued to work as an actress on television and in films, and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (alongside her Laverne and Shirley co-star Cindy Williams) in 2004.

June Foray was one of the leading voice artists of the golden age of animation, working with both the Warner Bros. animation department and the Disney studios, and later gained her greatest fame as the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel on the classic television cartoon series The Bullwinkle Show. Born in Springfield, MA, on September 18, 1917, Foray began her career as an actress at the age of 12 -- appropriately enough, by appearing in a radio drama at a local station in Springfield directed by her voice teacher. By the time Foray was 15, she was a regular at Springfield's WBZA, and two years later she was living in Los Angeles, hoping to break into the big time as an actress. At 19, Foray was both writing and starring in a radio series for children, as Miss Makebelieve, and soon became a frequent guest performer on a number of top-rated radio shows, working with the likes of Danny Thomas and Jimmy Durante. It was in the mid-'40s that Foray finally broke into the movies, but while she scored occasional onscreen roles (most notably as High Priestess Marku in the exotic drama Sabaka), she soon discovered there was a ready market for her vocal talents in Hollywood. Her first animation voice work was for Paramount's Speaking of Animals comedy shorts, in which animated mouths were superimposed on live-action footage of animals. The Speaking of Animals shorts spawned a series of records for children, recorded with a number of other noted voice actors, including Daws Butler and Stan Freeberg. The records made her a hot property with casting agents for cartoon voice work, and she found herself working for many of the biggest names in animation. For Chuck Jones at Warner Bros., Foray provided the voice of Granny in the Sylvester and Tweety cartoons, as well as the cackling Witch Hazel and dozens of other female characters. She recorded voices for several Tex Avery cartoons at MGM, as well as some Woody the Woodpecker shorts for Walter Lantz. And she made her debut at Disney as Lucifer the Cat in Cinderella. With the rise of television in the 1950s, a new market for cartoons appeared, and Foray's career kicked into high gear. She was cast as Rocky on The Bullwinkle Show, and also voiced a number of female characters on the series (most notably the villainous Natasha); she was also the voice of sweet-natured Nell Fenwick on the show's side series Dudley Do-Right. Foray stayed busy doing voice work on a number of other cartoon series as well, including Hoppity Hooper, Yogi the Bear, George of the Jungle, and the new Tom and Jerry shorts produced for TV in 1965. In addition, Foray did occasional work on The Flintstones, though she was passed over for the role of Betty Rubble after voicing her in the show's pilot. (Foray also appeared, uncredited, as the voice of Cindy Lou Who in Chuck Jones' classic animated version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas). In the 1980s and 1990s, at an age when most actresses would consider retirement, Foray was still one of Hollywood's busiest vocal talents, recording voices for everything from The Smurfs and Garfield to Duck Tales and The Simpsons. Foray also made a return to prestigious big-screen animation as the voice of Grandmother Fa in Mulan, and revisited her most famous role with vocal work in 2000's mixture of live-action and computer animation, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. In semi-retirement (though she still takes the occasional job that strikes her fancy), Foray is an active member of the International Animated Film Society, as well as the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.","vanity":"june_foray"}},{"id":"1066651","type":"movieCast","characters":["Florist"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770678509","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Paul Willson","bio":"","vanity":"paul_willson"}},{"id":"1066717","type":"movieCast","characters":["Gendarme Officer"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"771191443","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Christian Coffinet","bio":"","vanity":"christian_coffinet"}},{"id":"1066705","type":"movieCast","characters":["Sideshow Bob Terwilliger"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"162660300","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-40542","thumborId":"v1.cjs0MDU0MjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7Mjc1OzIzMA","height":230,"width":275,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FZrxZOSNhTGZYVaDVcicu--iM8kQ=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0MDU0MjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7Mjc1OzIzMA"},"name":"Kelsey Grammer","bio":"For better or worse, leading actor Kelsey Grammer's name will probably forever be associated with the pompous, garrulous, and self-absorbed but lovable psychiatrist Frasier Crane, a character Grammer has played on television since he first appeared on the NBC sitcom Cheers, in 1984, as a love interest for Shelley Long. Though Frasier was not intended to become a series regular, Grammer's performance of the blowhard neurotic charmed audiences and he remained with Cheers through its 1993 demise. At the beginning of the 1993-1994 television season, Grammer's character was resurrected in his own show and moved from Boston to Seattle, where he became a radio psychologist and faced a whole slew of folks just waiting to poke metaphorical pins in his hot air balloon. Thanks to excellent performances and top-notch writing, Frasier became as big a hit as its predecessor. Grammer won three Emmy awards and was nominated for seven more (twice for Cheers, once for his guest appearance on a 1992 episode of Wings, four times for Frasier) for playing the character. Born on St. Thomas, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Grammer knew extreme tragedy in youth. Following the shooting death of his father when he was a boy, he was raised in New Jersey and then Florida, by his mother and grandfather. His grandfather died before Grammer became a teen. When he was 20, his sister was abducted and violently murdered. Five years later, he lost two half brothers in a diving accident. As a young man, Grammer found comfort in Shakespeare; with his acting debut in a high school production of The Little Foxes came an interest in pursuing drama as a career. He enrolled in Juilliard, but dropped out after two years to work at San Diego's Old Globe Theater, where he gained three years' invaluable experience performing in Shakespearean and classical dramas; afterward, Grammer performed in productions across the country. He eventually made it to Broadway, where he appeared in various productions, including Othello. Prior to playing Frasier, Grammer appeared occasionally on television and had regular roles in three soap operas, including One Life to Live. He continues to occasionally guest star on other series. Fans of the animated satire The Simpsons will recognize his periodic voice characterization as the venomous Sideshow Bob. Miniseries and telemovies in which he has appeared include London Suite and Beyond Suspicion. Grammer made his feature film debut with a small role in Top of the Hill (1989) and had his first starring role in the much-panned comedy Down Periscope (1996). In addition to his Emmy kudos, Grammer has received an American Comedy Award, two Golden Globes, and a People's Choice Award. In 1995, he published his autobiography So Far.Grammer would spend the following years taking on TV roles on shows like Back to You and Boss, but would find even more success as a producer, helping bring shows like The Game, Girlfriends, Hank, Medium, and World Cup Comedy to fruition. In 2014, he returned to acting in a big way, making a cameo appearance in X-Men: Days of Future Past, reprising his role as Beast, playing the bad guy in Transformers: Age of Extinction, and returning to television in the FX series Partners.","vanity":"kelsey_grammer"}}],"startDate":"Dec 17, 1989","startYear":1989,"tomatometer":{"numReviews":18,"freshCount":18,"rottenCount":0,"tomatometer":100,"averageScore":8.5,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":"\u003Cem\u003EThe Simpsons\u003C\u002Fem\u003E' first season proves a quickly addictive introduction to America's animated first family with a run of entertaining episodes that set the stage for a groundbreaking series.","state":"fresh","certifiedFresh":false},"topTomatometer":{"id":"tt-3805","type":"topTomatometer","rottenCount":0,"tomatometer":"100","numReviews":11,"averageScore":"8.33","consensus":null,"isEmbargoed":false,"episodeAvgScore":null,"state":"fresh","category":"tvSeason","certifiedFresh":"false","freshCount":11,"tvSeriesId":"2210","episodesWithScore":null},"tvEpisodes":[{"id":"65023","type":"tvEpisode","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":0,"freshCount":0,"rottenCount":0,"tomatometer":null,"averageScore":0,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"NA","certifiedFresh":false},"airDate":"Dec 17, 1989","heroImage":null,"synopsis":"The Simpsons Christmas Special is actually the first full-length episode of the popular animated television sitcom.

Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to help Bart return the head, but they run afoul of an angry mob protesting the desecration of the statue. \"The Telltale Head\" was first aired on February 25, 1990.","runningTime":30,"title":"The Telltale Head","posterImage":{"id":"t-67523","type":"Image","thumborId":"v1.dDs2NzUyMztqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7MTI3ODsxODE4","height":1818,"width":1278,"format":"JPG","caption":null,"lastUpdateDate":"2013-08-29"},"episodeNumber":8,"network":"FOX","seasonTitle":"Season 1","isEmbargoed":false,"vanityUrl":"\u002Ftv\u002Fthe_simpsons\u002Fs01\u002Fe08","mainTrailer":null,"genre":"Animation","tvSeasonId":3805},{"id":"65029","type":"tvEpisode","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":0,"freshCount":0,"rottenCount":0,"tomatometer":null,"averageScore":0,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"NA","certifiedFresh":false},"airDate":"Mar 18, 1990","heroImage":null,"synopsis":"Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a reputation for not being very good at picking out gifts for his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), as evidenced by such past birthday presents as a tackle box and a Connie Chung calendar, but he hits a new low when Marge finds she's the recipient of a new bowling ball -- which has been drilled to fit Homer's hand and even has his name engraved on it. Marge is furious that Homer used her birthday as an excuse to get himself a gift, and while she doesn't bowl, she decides to learn just out of spite. Marge's early attempts to teach herself the game are disastrous, but she soon attracts the attention of Jacques (voice of Albert Brooks), a local professional bowler who has a French accent and a way with the ladies. Marge is more than flattered by the attention she's receiving from Jacques (who, just because he likes her, cuts his lesson fee from $50 to $25), and she begins spending more and more time with him.

Born February 25th, 1954, Matt Groening has managed to capture a realistically outrageous family dynamic in one of television history's longest-running shows that had been awarded 18 Emmy Awards by 2003. Born February 15, 1954, the Portland, OR, native was encouraged to draw by his father, who was also a cartoonist. He doodled his way through school, working for the newspaper and also forming a political party called Teens for Decency. With the slogan of \"If You're Against Decency, What Are You For?,\" he mischievously won the student body presidency. After graduating from Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA, in 1977, he headed out to L.A. To keep friends and relatives informed on how his life was progressing -- or actually, was not -- his letters home detailed his jobs at a sewage treatment plant and as a chauffeur in comic strip form. And thus, Life in Hell was born. The adventures of lead character Binky, his wife Sheba, and Akbar and Jeff, among others, made their way into the Los Angeles Reader in 1980 and can now be found in 250 newspapers worldwide. His next venture would also prove to be long lasting. What started out as animated segments aired during Fox's The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, The Simpsons got its own timeslot in December 1989. Groening and his team of writers and producers crafted the not-so-atypical family and their friends and neighbors in a comedic light, keeping them all just on the edge of ridiculousness. One episode captures America's favorite under-achieving dad Homer in one of his many schemes as he gains enough weight to be considered medically obese, thus excusing him from having to actually go to work. He instead stays home wearing a muumuu hollering at local kids who come by for a laugh at his expense. As is common, yet trivial Simpsons knowledge, the characters on the series have been named after Groening's family members, as Homer and Marge truly are his parents' names, and so on. As one to pay homage to his beginnings, Groening has the littlest Simpson, Maggie, lugging around a rabbit stuffed animal, which is one of his Life in Hell characters. Creating the sarcastic landscape that is Springfield, he infused his witty outlook on life and said when people watch The Simpsons, they are rewarded for paying attention with inside and\u002For well-placed jokes. Case in point, Homer decries cartoon writers for their unrealistic story lines; meanwhile, another Homer walks by the window in quite an unfathomable manner. Such humor is lost on some, but has been impressed on enough hearts and minds to keep people tuning in every Sunday night. Groening also dabbled in album cover art design, which can be found on the 1987 self-titled album from Crazy Backwards Alphabet. In 1993, he formed Bongo Comics, which publishes Simpsons-related Itchy & Scratchy, Radioactive Man, Lisa, and Krusty comics. He also started Zongo Comics in 1995. Books and guides giving detailed information on The Simpsons series have been published, including The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family. Games, both board and video, have also been produced involving the famous inhabitants of 742 Evergreen Terrace and Groening has also written books featuring his Life in Hell characters, including Childhood Is Hell, Love Is Hell, School Is Hell, and The Big Book of Hell. His next venture was into the future with the appropriately titled Futurama. Premiering in March 1999 and featuring the voice of Ren and Stimpy, Billy West, the sci-fi cartoon series started with the main character, Fry, delivering a pizza to a cryogenics lab. He ends up being frozen and when he wakes up in the year 3000, he's stuck marveling at the future while lamenting about his lost past with the likes of a one-eyed love interest, a robotic best friend, and a crab as a doctor.

Brooks","bio":"One of the few producer\u002Fdirector\u002Fwriters to handle both movie and TV assignments with equal aplomb, James L. Brooks was born in Brooklyn and spent his college years in New York City. Following an apprenticeship with CBS news, Brooks went to work for documentary producer David L. Wolper. In 1969, Brooks broke into the non-documentary end of the business with his TV series drama Room 222, which, though dated and obvious when viewed today, was an important stepping stone in improving the racial balance on prime time television. Room 222 was a \"serious\" effort; thus, Hollywood insiders were surprised when Brooks formed a partnership with writer Allan Burns, formerly of such raucous projects as The Bullwinkle Show and My Mother the Car, to develop sitcoms. Brooks and Burns knew what sort of programs they wanted to do, but they were forced to fight tooth and nail with the CBS higher-ups to get what they wanted on the air. Nobody, they were told, wanted to see a show about a single woman working at a television station. Further, nobody wanted to see anyone on TV who was Jewish, had a mustache, or came from New York City. All these \"unwanted\" elements would be present in the Brooks\u002FBurns project The Mary Tyler Moore Show; the show that nobody wanted ran from 1970 through 1977, earning its production team a multitude of awards. Brooks would later be on the ground floor of such TV hits as Cheers and Taxi, which more than compensated for such relative failures as The Associates. Moving into films as a producer\u002Fscripter (Starting Over, 1979) and even an occasional actor (Albert Brooks's Modern Romance, 1981), Brooks would end up director\u002Fproducer\u002Fwriter of Terms of Endearment, the Academy Award winner of 1983. He went on to direct Broadcast News (1987), a truer but no less hilarious and poignant glance at the cutthroat network news business than Mary Tyler Moore Show had been. He also found great success as a producer on such films as Big (1988), ...Say Anything (1989), and Jerry Maguire (1996). During the '90s, Brooks has had equal parts success and failure. Among the winning projects was The Simpsons, the first successful prime time cartoon series since The Flintstones. Brooks' less spectacular efforts have included I'll Do Anything (1994); conceived and filmed as a return to the Big-Budget Musical genre, it tested so poorly that it was released with all the songs cut out. In 1997, however, Brooks had a major success with the Jack Nicholson\u002FHelen Hunt vehicle As Good As It Gets, a caustic comedy with a heart of gold that provided both Hunt and Nicholson best acting kudos from the Oscars and Golden Globe ceremonies. The film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture and was nominated for several more. It also received several more Oscar nominations, including one for Best Screenplay. He took seven years before making his next feature, Spanglish, a movie about a marriage on the rocks that Brooks undertook around the time he and his own wife split. Three years later he was one of the producers of The Simpsons Movie, and in 2010 he returned with the romantic comedy How Do You Know.","vanity":"james_l_brooks"}},{"id":"4980173","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"770673771","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Al Jean","bio":"","vanity":"al_jean"}},{"id":"4980174","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"770901538","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Ian Maxtone-Graham","bio":"","vanity":"ian_maxtone_graham"}},{"id":"4980175","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"770901542","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Matt Selman","bio":"","vanity":"matt_selman"}},{"id":"4980208","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"770808600","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Sam Simon","bio":"\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ETV writer and producer Sam Simon is perhaps best known as one of the original creators of the landmark animated series The Simpsons.

Simpson on Matt Groening and James L. Brooks' long, long-running Fox animated sitcom The Simpsons, Dan Castellaneta is well-reputed for his modest, unassuming presence in real life and his paradoxical ability to spin characters -- seemingly from out of nowhere -- that instantly take on lives of their own. Groening once famously remarked that \"Dan can do everything, and he practically does....You might never notice him, but then he opens his mouth and he completely creates one character after another.'' Born in 1957, Castellaneta grew up in the small town of Oak Grove, IL, in the northwestern corner of the state, near the Iowa border. As a self-described introvert who developed and honed a facility for slipping into the guise of characters to entertain and make social situations easier (read: class clown), Castellaneta nevertheless diverged from this path in college and worked toward a career as a high-school art teacher via his studies at Northern Illinois University. Then, one of Castellaneta's professors (perhaps sensing some dissatisfaction) wisely admonished him to only work at a field, and in a job, that he loved. Castellaneta reasoned that acting fit the bill, and auditioned for the infamous sketch comedy troupe Second City shortly after graduation. The troupe hired him, and in time, the skills that the actor projected led to his involvement on the then-fledgling Fox network's sketch comedy series The Tracey Ullman Show, which premiered on Sunday, April 5, 1987. Castellaneta joined Ullman, Julie Kavner, Joe Malone, Sam McMurray, and for a time Anna Levine in live-action skits that parodied all aspects of Western culture.As a most unusual aspect of her program, Ullman opted to feature crudely animated, offbeat segments as Monty Python-style transitions between the individual sketches. The episodes in question were drawn by Gabor Csupo and Groening (at that time, comic-strip artist of growing infamy known for his Life Is Hell series starring a buck-toothed, bug-eyed rabbit named Bucky). Although the subjects of the shorts initially varied, within a few months they began to focus exclusively on a hyper-dysfunctional blue-collar family called the Simpsons; Kavner and Castellaneta voiced parents Homer and Marge Simpson, respectively. Those segments gained such massive popularity that they eventually outshone that of the Ullman show itself (which wrapped in September 1990), and executive producer James L. Brooks, following this cue, decided to spin off the Simpsons into their own weekly animated series. Kavner and Castellaneta, of course, followed Brooks to the new program, joined in time by longtime Brooks acquaintance Harry Shearer, as well as Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and numerous others.The Simpsons premiered on Fox on December 17, 1989, and became not simply a hit but a phenomenon. It shot up to instantly become one of the highest-rated series on television, and attained iconic status. The program scored as a cause célèbre not simply with children (as expected) but with adult viewers as well, who appreciated the show's ability to skewer all aspects of society and culture. (It generated a billion-dollar marketing boom as well -- an onslaught of Bart Simpson-themed T-shirts, watches, dolls, beach towels, and everything else under the sun.) The program also drew an onslaught of celebrity guests -- everyone from Larry King to Tony Bennett to Beverly D'Angelo and Linda Ronstadt. Castellaneta himself will forever be tied to Homer Simpson -- the lunkheaded, potbellied, beer-swilling, donut-loving nuclear-plant worker with not a whole lot upstairs, and a thoroughly crass lifestyle, but also a big, soft heart (a quality which Castellaneta's co-workers insist that he alone brought to the character). But hardcore Simpsons cultists and even its less attentive devotees will realize that Castellaneta voices not only Homer (as mentioned), but also the gravel","vanity":"dan_castellaneta"}},{"id":"1066683","type":"movieCast","characters":["Marge Simpson\u002FPatty Bouvier\u002FSelma Bouvier"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"406923405","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-799566","thumborId":"v1.bjs3OTk1NjY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FhBE2CDjg0buhqxYQNmdtOJgG5mE=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3OTk1NjY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Julie Kavner","bio":"When the decision was made in 1974 to transform Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) from frumpy kvetcher to desirable bachelorette on the TV series Rhoda, somebody had to inherit all those self-deprecating jokes told by Rhoda on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The decision was made to create a new character: Rhoda's pudgy, insecure younger sister, Brenda. The actress chosen for the role sounded as though she'd been a New Yorker since the womb, but in fact Julie Kavner was born and raised in California. A theatre student at USC-San Francisco, Kavner came to Rhoda with no professional experience, but before the series ran its course, she had won an Emmy for her portrayal. With her performance in the 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters, Kavner became one of the most prominent members of director Woody Allen's stock company, essaying very un-Brendalike roles in Radio Days (1987), the \"Oedipus Wrecks\" segment of New York Stories (1989), Alice (1990) and Shadows and Fog (1992). Kavner's regular stint as an ensemble player on the Fox TV network's Tracy Ullman Show led to her long-running assignment as the gravelly voice of Marge Simpson on the weekly animated series The Simpsons. Even as she continued to work on The Simpsons for the nex twenty years, she would make occasional big-screen appearances in projects as diverse as I'll Do Anything, Forget Paris, Judy Berlin, and Click.She also maintained an ongoing working relationship with Woody Allen appearing in Deconstructing Harry and in the 1994 made-for TV adaptation of the famous director's play Don't Drink the Water.","vanity":"julie_kavner"}},{"id":"1066684","type":"movieCast","characters":["Bart Simpson\u002FNelson Muntz\u002FTodd Flanders\u002FRalph Wiggum\u002FKearney"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"406923407","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-786561","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODY1NjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzQwMDs2MDA","height":600,"width":400,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FmxXoHAD24CqODhvuEfZ3UTW6kqU=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODY1NjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzQwMDs2MDA"},"name":"Nancy Cartwright","bio":"Eternally known as the voice of Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright is one of the most prolific voice actors of her time. Born in an Ohio suburb in the late '50s, she grew up doing community theater and watching cartoons. In her last year at Ohio University, she got a chance to meet Hanna-Barbara voice actor Daws Butler. Better known by his character names Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, and Quick Draw McGraw, Butler suggested she transfer to U.C.L.A. and start going to auditions. By 1980, Cartwright had her first professional job as the voice of Gloria on Richie Rich. With her new Screen Actors Guild card, she also got normal acting roles on the TV movie Marian Rose White, the feature film Twilight Zone: The Movie, and several television guest appearances. Her voice was heard as multiple characters on beloved '80s cartoons like My Little Pony & Friends, Pound Puppies, Space Ace, and Galaxy High School. Eventually Cartwright started to get singular roles like Kip on ShirtTales and Daphne on Snorks. In 1987, she auditioned for the role of Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons but she landed the role of Bart instead. After a few years of shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons got its own time slot on FOX in 1990. Cartwright won an Emmy and an Annie award for her work, which has expanded to several other Springfield youths including Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, Milhouse, Kearney, and Nelson. While still working on The Simpsons, she also did voices for Animaniacs, Goof Troop, and The Critic, as well as numerous short-lived cartoons (remember God, the Devil and Bob?). Cartwright has also found time to perform the one-woman play In Search of Fellini and write her autobiography My Life as a Ten-Year-Old Boy. In 2001 she took over for Christine Cavanaugh in the role of Chuckie on Rugrats while working on Kim Possible and launching her Internet animation company, SportsBlast. Her voice can also be heard on the web cartoons The Kellys and Timberwolf.Cartwright would continue to remain an extremely active force in the world of voice acting over the coming years, most notably on series like All Grown Up, The Replacements, and Betsy's Kindergarten Adventures.","vanity":"nancy_cartwright"}},{"id":"1066685","type":"movieCast","characters":["Lisa Simpson"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"408823130","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-786321","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODYzMjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FvUmJUrTPoKQQgr8cg22EUtFT6hs=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODYzMjE7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Yeardley Smith","bio":"Yeardley Smith is unarguably the keeper of one of Hollywood's most distinctive-sounding and instantly recognizable set of vocal chords; the Emmy-winning actress' most famous role is without question that of level-headed, suburban schoolgirl Lisa Simpson on the long-running animated television series The Simpsons. Though most of her live-action roles would come during the mid-'80s with such guilty pleasures as The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive, Smith remained active in front of the camera well into the new millennium with roles in such features as As Good As It Gets and such popular television series as Dharma & Greg. Born in Paris, France, Smith kicked off her acting career at Washington, D.C.'s Arena Stage before making the move to Broadway in Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing in 1984. A role in the after-school special Mom's on Strike marked the actress' first foray into television, and after graduating to features with a supporting role in the 1985 comedy Heaven Help Us, she gained notable exposure later that same year in the teen drama The Legend of Billie Jean. If the film failed to live up to the hype, Smith's performance (as a somewhat shy teen who discovers her own self-confidence after joining a teenage outlaw on the road) offered a scene-stealing turn that would overflow into the following year's much-maligned horror film Maximum Overdrive. A small supporting role in the 1987 teen comedy Three O'Clock High was quick to follow, and that same year, Smith would step behind the microphone for the role that would change her life. Originally conceived as a series of shorts made to run during The Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons proved so popular that it was soon given its very own series. Beginning in 1989, The Simpsons quickly became nothing less than a cultural phenomenon, with brother Bart's rebellious antics quickly making \"Don't have a cow, man\" the national catch phrase. As popular as the series was initially, few could have foreseen that it would go on to surpass The Flintstones as the longest-running animated prime-time series in the history of television. In the years that followed, Lisa would move to the forefront in many episodes, endearing her to a nation of television viewers. Though Smith would still make the occasional foray into features, with bit roles in City Slickers, Toys, Just Write, and As Good As It Gets, it was her role on The Simpsons that kept her busy throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium.Aside from voicing Lisa Simpson she didn't appear on-screen in the first decade of the 21st century, but she returned with bit parts in movies like HIGH School and New Year's Eve in 2010 and 2011.","vanity":"yeardley_smith"}},{"id":"1066686","type":"movieCast","characters":["Mr. Burns\u002FLenny\u002FNed Flanders\u002FSeymour Skinner\u002FWaylon Smithers"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"162658996","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-796325","thumborId":"v1.bjs3OTYzMjU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FnbwZHXGz8eXh4W1HzBQyjN7I2J4=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3OTYzMjU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Harry Shearer","bio":"California native Harry Shearer was one of the busier child actors of the 1950s. He appeared in such films as The Robe (1953) (as the boy David) and Abbott and Costello Go to Mars (1953); he could be heard on such radio programs as Suspense, Lux Radio Theatre, and the Jack Benny Show; and among his many TV guest roles was the character who would evolve into Eddie Haskell in the 1955 Leave It to Beaver pilot. After attending U.C.L.A., Shearer flourished as a standup comedian and comedy writer. He was frequently employed on the writing staff for such TV laughspinners as Laverne and Shirley and America 2Night; he also worked both sides of the camera in the 1984 rockumentary parody This Is Spinal Tap, co-starring as rock idol Derek Smalls and co-writing the script with director Rob Reiner and fellow cast members Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.

Azaria scored his breakthrough in 1989 when he began providing a multitude of voices for the Fox network's groundbreaking animated series The Simpsons, an assignment that imparted the performer with an enviable degree of cult stardom. In 1991, Azaria nabbed a major role in the Fox live-action sitcom Herman's Head, which ran until 1994 and gave audiences a glimpse of the man responsible for the vocal intonations of some of the most famous characters to ever corrupt an animator's storyboard.A native of Queens, NY, where he was born into a family of Sephardic Jews on April 25, 1964, Azaria commenced film roles in the late 1980s, coincident with his Simpsons stardom. Work on that program (which, after graduating from a series of crude sketches on The Tracey Ullmann Show to its own animated sitcom, quickly shot up to qualify as the Fox network's most popular enterprise) easily outstripped Azaria's screen work in popularity and visibility for many years. Recurring parts included Indian convenience store owner Apu, quack doctor Nick Riviera, dim-witted bartender Moe, and the idiotic, pig-nosed Springfield Chief of Police, Clancy Wiggum. Though his Simpsons work continued unabated over the years, beginning in the mid-1990s Azaria branched out somewhat, placing a heavier emphasis on live-action portrayals. Even in that venue, however, his work tonally mirrored his animated contributions; he specialized in adroitly handling goofy, over-the-top character parts, often with an ethnic bent. The performer attained visibility and memorability, for example, as the klutzy and scantily-dressed gay houseboy Agador in The Birdcage (1995), Hector, a goofy Hispanic paramour with a permanent effeminate lisp, in Joe Roth's underrated showbiz comedy America's Sweethearts (2001), and Claude, a Gallic beach bum with no qualms about taking off with other men's wives, in John Hamburg's gross-out romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004).Azaria has also departed from the boundaries of screen comedy from time to time, doing memorable work across genre lines in such films as Great Expectations (1998) (which cast him as Gwyneth Paltrow's lackluster fiancé), Mystery Men (1999) (as the superhero Blue Raja), and Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock (1999), a historical drama about art and politics in 1930s New York that cast Azaria as leftist playwright Marc Blitzstein. In 2005, Azaria presided as one of the many off-color monologuists in Penn Jillette's stand-up comedy showcase film The Aristocrats; the performer subsequently provided at least seventeen voices (including his usual series roles) for The Simpsons Movie (2007) and voiced both Abbie Hoffmann and Allen Ginsberg in the animated sequences of Brett Morgen's offbeat documentary Chicago 10 (2007).He appeared in the pre-historic comedy Year One, and provided several voices in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He played an ethically challenged doctor in Love and Other Drugs, and portrayed Gargamel, the bad guy in the big-screen hit The Smurfs. He was in family film Hop, and lent his prodigious vocal talents to Happy Feet Two. In 2012 he acted in the biopic Lovelace.In July 1999, Azaria married actress Helen Hunt, with whom he co-starred in several episodes of the sitcom Mad About You. The two divorced within eighteen months.","vanity":"hank_azaria"}},{"id":"1066687","type":"movieCast","characters":["Milhouse Van Houten\u002FRod Flanders"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770708084","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-1230686","thumborId":"v1.bjsxMjMwNjg2O2o7MTg3MTY7MTIwMDs0ODU7NDc2","height":476,"width":485,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FR3PG99iZJpHED-WiNJeVNf3nrMg=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjsxMjMwNjg2O2o7MTg3MTY7MTIwMDs0ODU7NDc2"},"name":"Pamela Hayden","bio":"","vanity":"pamela_hayden"}},{"id":"1066665","type":"movieCast","characters":["Edna Krabappel"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770752922","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-781346","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODEzNDY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FonwjgaQT6WDyqTshFFeBf9XRLd4=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODEzNDY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Marcia Wallace","bio":"Actress and comedian Marcia Wallace began her career as a stage actress, appearing with the improv troupe The Fourth Wall and in off-Broadway plays in the late '60s.

The son of comedian Harry Einstein (better known to millions of radio fans as Parkyakarkus), Brooks briefly attended Carnegie Tech before launching a hills-and-valley career as a standup comic. Like such contemporaries as George Carlin and Robert Klein, Brooks delighted in finding humor in the inconsistencies of everyday life, and had a particular fondness for exploiting clichés that many people never realized were clichés. Two of his most fondly remembered routines involved a talking mime and a ritualistic recital of the ingredients in a carton of Cool-Whip. After appearing as a regular on the 1969-1970 season of The Dean Martin Show (as well as its 1971 spin-off The Golddiggers), Brooks gained instant pop-culture fame for his brilliant short-subject directorial debut, The Famous Comedian's School, which was highlighted on a 1971 installment of The Great American Dream Machine. Even today, comedy buffs can cite from memory the particulars of \"The Danny Thomas\u002FSid Melton School of Coffee-Spitting.\" In 1975, Brooks won a Grammy for his album A Star Is Bought; that same year, he began filming short sketches for Saturday Night Live. Though often the highlights of that series' first season, Brooks' skits were dropped from SNL because they were considered \"too inside.\" Brooks made his theatrical film debut in 1976, playing Cybill Shepherd's clueless co-worker in Taxi Driver. His subsequent film roles included the first husband of Goldie Hawn in Private Benjamin (1980), Dudley Moore's cuckolded manager in Unfaithfully Yours (1984), and, best of all, his Oscar-nominated turn as the acerbic, freely perspiring TV journalist Aaron Altman in Broadcast News (1987). Even more impressive have been Brooks' credits as writer\u002Fdirector, including the PBS-documentary lampoon Real Life (1979), the angst-driven Modern Romance (1981), the yuppie odyssey Lost in America (1985), and the \"Heaven is a Strip Mall\" fantasy Defending Your Life (1991). In 1994, Brooks both wrote and acted in the darkly humorous baseball film The Scout. In 1996, he directed, wrote, and starred opposite Debbie Reynolds (making her first screen appearance in over two decades) in Mother. After taking some time off from directing and scriptwriting to appear in such films as Out of Sight (1998), Brooks resumed his director-screenwriter-actor hyphenate with The Muse (1999), starring opposite Andie MacDowell and Sharon Stone as a struggling Hollywood scriptwriter in search of divine inspiration; Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World followed in 2005.Unarguably, Brooks's highest-profile performance came not in one of his directorial projects, but in the 2003 Pixar underwater adventure Finding Nemo. Lending his voice to the film's lead clown-fish, the critically-acclaimed picture went on to be one of the highest grossing movies of all time and also featured the talents of Ellen Degeneres and Willem Dafoe.He became part of the cast of the Showtime series Weeds as the main character's former father-in-law. 2011 turned out to be an excellent year for the revered performer. That year saw publication of his first novel, 2030, a comedy about the future of America. He also played the part of Bernie Rose, the bad guy in the hotly buzzed about action film Drive. Though he captured numerous year-end critics prizes, Brooks was denied an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.","vanity":"albert_brooks"}},{"id":"1725926","type":"movieCast","characters":["Adil"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"770683981","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-783015","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODMwMTU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzM5Mjs0MjE","height":421,"width":392,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fg4s781Q1phrBsqrvgajcWzdj6do=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODMwMTU7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzM5Mjs0MjE"},"name":"Tress MacNeille","bio":"","vanity":"tress_macneille"}},{"id":"1066723","type":"movieCast","characters":["Weasel #1"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"408746708","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-788732","thumborId":"v1.bjs3ODg3MzI7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA","height":720,"width":540,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FPPCmj3QZbnPRhYGPW0Rm51wDFqU=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3ODg3MzI7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzU0MDs3MjA"},"name":"Susan Blu","bio":"","vanity":"susan_blu"}},{"id":"1066759","type":"movieCast","characters":["SNPP Employee\u002FDuff Commercial VO"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770683355","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-794056","thumborId":"v1.bjs3OTQwNTY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzUzMzs4MDA","height":800,"width":533,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FsssrzkNhBOEvuSHkZ8n3wJzq7G8=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs3OTQwNTY7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzUzMzs4MDA"},"name":"Sam McMurray","bio":"Dark-haired character actor Sam McMurray has made a career of playing gaseous windbags of low moral fiber, often adding a salacious sneer to heighten the effect. However, his comic persona also sometimes slants toward lovable obliviousness, making McMurray a desired commodity in broad comedy, as well as a sitcom mainstay.The New York native got his start in acting with bit parts on television and in the movies in the late '70s and early '80s. In 1987, McMurray had a breakout year of sorts, appearing as a regular on The Tracey Ullman Show (which led to vocal work in the early seasons of The Simpsons) and snagging the film role for which he is best known. In Joel and Ethan Coen's Raising Arizona, McMurray was cast as Glen, Nicolas Cage's factory foreman boss, who runs afoul of Cage's H.I. McDonnough after he proposes swapping wives. In only a handful of scenes, McMurray creates an indelible and hilarious image of a loud, crass, humor-impaired buffoon who resides over a brood of ill-mannered children, but wants to add at least one more to the mix.Raising Arizona paved the way for supporting work in a number of high-profile comedies in the ensuing years, including National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), L.A. Story (1991), and Addams Family Values (1993). In 1991, he voiced a character in the Disney\u002FABC live-action TV show Dinosaurs; he would later also provide vocal work for the animated Disney program Recess (1997). Television has provided McMurray with his most regular paychecks, most often in the capacity of a guest performer, both in dramas and sitcoms. He guested as Chandler's boss on several episodes of Friends in 1997, and also made repeat appearances in such shows as The King of Queens, Freaks and Geeks, and Chicago Hope. His recent film work has included a shady detective in The Mod Squad (1999) and a scoundrel cheerleader dad in Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999).","vanity":"sam_mcmurray"}},{"id":"30737120","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"772024337","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Norbert Gastell","bio":null,"vanity":"norbert_gastell"}},{"id":"30737121","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"771070916","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Sandra Schwittau","bio":"","vanity":"sandra_schwittau"}},{"id":"1066671","type":"movieCast","characters":["Miss Barr"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770674538","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-804210","thumborId":"v1.bjs4MDQyMTA7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzg2NDs5NTA","height":950,"width":864,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fc9qBRBtItaUF6211-xElcDePaDI=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.bjs4MDQyMTA7ajsxODcxMTsxMjAwOzg2NDs5NTA"},"name":"Miriam Flynn","bio":"","vanity":"miriam_flynn"}},{"id":"1066648","type":"movieCast","characters":["Ms. Botz"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"162652584","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-38476","thumborId":"v1.cjszODQ3NjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7NDI2OzY1Mg","height":652,"width":426,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FESKBgrssIRdnsNgHlHWNayIzchM=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjszODQ3NjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7NDI2OzY1Mg"},"name":"Penny Marshall","bio":"Instantly recognizable for her cute overbite, raucous voice, and broad Bronx accent, Penny Marshall successfully made the transition from popular comic actress to a respected director and producer of popular mainstream feature films. A New York native (born Carole Penny Marsciarelli), Marshall is the daughter of an industrial filmmaker and a dance instructor. She started dancing herself as a toddler and as a teen competed on The Ted Mack Amateur Hour with a dance troupe comprised of several friends. The group also appeared on The Jackie Gleason Show. By the time she was a young adult and had graduated with degrees in math and psychology from the University of New Mexico, her older brother, Garry Marshall, had established himself as a successful television writer. It was Garry who provided Marshall with her first film role in his feature film debut effort as a screenwriter and producer in How Sweet It Is (1968).When her brother began creating and producing situation comedies, he made sure Marshall had parts in his shows, the first of which was My Friend Tony and the second was The Odd Couple, where she had a recurring role. Marshall also guest starred on other comedies, including The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but her big break didn't come until her brother cast her and her friend Cindy Williams as Laverne and Shirley in an episode of his popular series Happy Days. Her portrayal of a wiseacre working-class broad and Williams' take on the more innocent Shirley gained an instant fan base and so Garry Marshall was inspired to build a sitcom around the characters. Laverne and Shirley debuted in 1978 and ran through 1983. During this period, Marshall was married to actor-turned-director Rob Reiner. She divorced him in the early '80s. At that time, it was apparent that her acting career was on a dead-end street and Marshall decided to try out directing. Beginning with television movies and series such as The Tracey Ullman Show, Marshall learned to direct. She made her feature film directorial debut with the Whoopi Goldberg vehicle Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986) which had originally been slated for director Howard Zieff. Returning her brother's favors, she gave him a part in the film and also created a part for her daughter, Tracy Reiner (the offspring from Marshall's first marriage to Michael Henry). The film was a critical and box-office dud, but this did not deter Marshall from trying again. Her second attempt at directing, Big (1988), the story of a boy whose wish is granted and so finds himself stranded in a man's body, made actor Tom Hanks a movie star and established Marshall as a respectable big-league filmmaker. Still, she took two years to finish her next film, Awakenings (1990). This was due in part to 20th Century Fox's reluctance to have the story filmed until Marshall had engaged her friends Robin Williams, in a rare subdued dramatic role, and Robert De Niro. A well-made and poignant drama, Awakenings received three Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. For her next film, Marshall offered up a sentimental, funny, and ebullient look at the women who kept professional baseball alive when all the young men were off fighting during WWII in A League of Their Own (1992). It was a well-crafted effort that has grown in popularity on video and netted star Geena Davis a Golden Globe nomination. Since then, Marshall's directorial output yielded uneven results and her films, while still loaded with mainstream appeal, had yet to reach the degree of popularity of her earlier work. In the late '90s, she and her much-younger pal, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, became popular for a series of television commercials for K-Mart. In addition to directing and producing, Marshall occasionally continued to work as an actress on television and in films, and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (alongside her Laverne and Shirley co-star Cindy Williams) in 2004.

June Foray was one of the leading voice artists of the golden age of animation, working with both the Warner Bros. animation department and the Disney studios, and later gained her greatest fame as the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel on the classic television cartoon series The Bullwinkle Show. Born in Springfield, MA, on September 18, 1917, Foray began her career as an actress at the age of 12 -- appropriately enough, by appearing in a radio drama at a local station in Springfield directed by her voice teacher. By the time Foray was 15, she was a regular at Springfield's WBZA, and two years later she was living in Los Angeles, hoping to break into the big time as an actress. At 19, Foray was both writing and starring in a radio series for children, as Miss Makebelieve, and soon became a frequent guest performer on a number of top-rated radio shows, working with the likes of Danny Thomas and Jimmy Durante. It was in the mid-'40s that Foray finally broke into the movies, but while she scored occasional onscreen roles (most notably as High Priestess Marku in the exotic drama Sabaka), she soon discovered there was a ready market for her vocal talents in Hollywood. Her first animation voice work was for Paramount's Speaking of Animals comedy shorts, in which animated mouths were superimposed on live-action footage of animals. The Speaking of Animals shorts spawned a series of records for children, recorded with a number of other noted voice actors, including Daws Butler and Stan Freeberg. The records made her a hot property with casting agents for cartoon voice work, and she found herself working for many of the biggest names in animation. For Chuck Jones at Warner Bros., Foray provided the voice of Granny in the Sylvester and Tweety cartoons, as well as the cackling Witch Hazel and dozens of other female characters. She recorded voices for several Tex Avery cartoons at MGM, as well as some Woody the Woodpecker shorts for Walter Lantz. And she made her debut at Disney as Lucifer the Cat in Cinderella. With the rise of television in the 1950s, a new market for cartoons appeared, and Foray's career kicked into high gear. She was cast as Rocky on The Bullwinkle Show, and also voiced a number of female characters on the series (most notably the villainous Natasha); she was also the voice of sweet-natured Nell Fenwick on the show's side series Dudley Do-Right. Foray stayed busy doing voice work on a number of other cartoon series as well, including Hoppity Hooper, Yogi the Bear, George of the Jungle, and the new Tom and Jerry shorts produced for TV in 1965. In addition, Foray did occasional work on The Flintstones, though she was passed over for the role of Betty Rubble after voicing her in the show's pilot. (Foray also appeared, uncredited, as the voice of Cindy Lou Who in Chuck Jones' classic animated version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas). In the 1980s and 1990s, at an age when most actresses would consider retirement, Foray was still one of Hollywood's busiest vocal talents, recording voices for everything from The Smurfs and Garfield to Duck Tales and The Simpsons. Foray also made a return to prestigious big-screen animation as the voice of Grandmother Fa in Mulan, and revisited her most famous role with vocal work in 2000's mixture of live-action and computer animation, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. In semi-retirement (though she still takes the occasional job that strikes her fancy), Foray is an active member of the International Animated Film Society, as well as the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.","vanity":"june_foray"}},{"id":"1066651","type":"movieCast","characters":["Florist"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"770678509","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Paul Willson","bio":"","vanity":"paul_willson"}},{"id":"1066717","type":"movieCast","characters":["Gendarme Officer"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"771191443","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Christian Coffinet","bio":"","vanity":"christian_coffinet"}},{"id":"1066705","type":"movieCast","characters":["Sideshow Bob Terwilliger"],"role":"Voice","person":{"id":"162660300","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-40542","thumborId":"v1.cjs0MDU0MjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7Mjc1OzIzMA","height":230,"width":275,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FZrxZOSNhTGZYVaDVcicu--iM8kQ=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0MDU0MjtqOzE4NzAzOzEyMDA7Mjc1OzIzMA"},"name":"Kelsey Grammer","bio":"For better or worse, leading actor Kelsey Grammer's name will probably forever be associated with the pompous, garrulous, and self-absorbed but lovable psychiatrist Frasier Crane, a character Grammer has played on television since he first appeared on the NBC sitcom Cheers, in 1984, as a love interest for Shelley Long. Though Frasier was not intended to become a series regular, Grammer's performance of the blowhard neurotic charmed audiences and he remained with Cheers through its 1993 demise. At the beginning of the 1993-1994 television season, Grammer's character was resurrected in his own show and moved from Boston to Seattle, where he became a radio psychologist and faced a whole slew of folks just waiting to poke metaphorical pins in his hot air balloon. Thanks to excellent performances and top-notch writing, Frasier became as big a hit as its predecessor. Grammer won three Emmy awards and was nominated for seven more (twice for Cheers, once for his guest appearance on a 1992 episode of Wings, four times for Frasier) for playing the character. Born on St. Thomas, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Grammer knew extreme tragedy in youth. Following the shooting death of his father when he was a boy, he was raised in New Jersey and then Florida, by his mother and grandfather. His grandfather died before Grammer became a teen. When he was 20, his sister was abducted and violently murdered. Five years later, he lost two half brothers in a diving accident. As a young man, Grammer found comfort in Shakespeare; with his acting debut in a high school production of The Little Foxes came an interest in pursuing drama as a career. He enrolled in Juilliard, but dropped out after two years to work at San Diego's Old Globe Theater, where he gained three years' invaluable experience performing in Shakespearean and classical dramas; afterward, Grammer performed in productions across the country. He eventually made it to Broadway, where he appeared in various productions, including Othello. Prior to playing Frasier, Grammer appeared occasionally on television and had regular roles in three soap operas, including One Life to Live. He continues to occasionally guest star on other series. Fans of the animated satire The Simpsons will recognize his periodic voice characterization as the venomous Sideshow Bob. Miniseries and telemovies in which he has appeared include London Suite and Beyond Suspicion. Grammer made his feature film debut with a small role in Top of the Hill (1989) and had his first starring role in the much-panned comedy Down Periscope (1996). In addition to his Emmy kudos, Grammer has received an American Comedy Award, two Golden Globes, and a People's Choice Award. In 1995, he published his autobiography So Far.Grammer would spend the following years taking on TV roles on shows like Back to You and Boss, but would find even more success as a producer, helping bring shows like The Game, Girlfriends, Hank, Medium, and World Cup Comedy to fruition. In 2014, he returned to acting in a big way, making a cameo appearance in X-Men: Days of Future Past, reprising his role as Beast, playing the bad guy in Transformers: Age of Extinction, and returning to television in the FX series Partners.","vanity":"kelsey_grammer"}}],"creators":[{"id":"1066688","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Creator","person":{"id":"326397311","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-4579","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NTc5O2o7MTg3MDI7MTIwMDs0Njg7NjUy","height":652,"width":468,"format":"JPG"},"name":"Matt Groening","bio":"He put the \"d'oh!\" in the Oxford English Dictionary, the Canyonero on the road, and he's put The Simpsons in your living room every week. Born February 25th, 1954, Matt Groening has managed to capture a realistically outrageous family dynamic in one of television history's longest-running shows that had been awarded 18 Emmy Awards by 2003. Born February 15, 1954, the Portland, OR, native was encouraged to draw by his father, who was also a cartoonist. He doodled his way through school, working for the newspaper and also forming a political party called Teens for Decency. With the slogan of \"If You're Against Decency, What Are You For?,\" he mischievously won the student body presidency. After graduating from Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA, in 1977, he headed out to L.A. To keep friends and relatives informed on how his life was progressing -- or actually, was not -- his letters home detailed his jobs at a sewage treatment plant and as a chauffeur in comic strip form. And thus, Life in Hell was born. The adventures of lead character Binky, his wife Sheba, and Akbar and Jeff, among others, made their way into the Los Angeles Reader in 1980 and can now be found in 250 newspapers worldwide. His next venture would also prove to be long lasting. What started out as animated segments aired during Fox's The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, The Simpsons got its own timeslot in December 1989. Groening and his team of writers and producers crafted the not-so-atypical family and their friends and neighbors in a comedic light, keeping them all just on the edge of ridiculousness. One episode captures America's favorite under-achieving dad Homer in one of his many schemes as he gains enough weight to be considered medically obese, thus excusing him from having to actually go to work. He instead stays home wearing a muumuu hollering at local kids who come by for a laugh at his expense. As is common, yet trivial Simpsons knowledge, the characters on the series have been named after Groening's family members, as Homer and Marge truly are his parents' names, and so on. As one to pay homage to his beginnings, Groening has the littlest Simpson, Maggie, lugging around a rabbit stuffed animal, which is one of his Life in Hell characters. Creating the sarcastic landscape that is Springfield, he infused his witty outlook on life and said when people watch The Simpsons, they are rewarded for paying attention with inside and\u002For well-placed jokes. Case in point, Homer decries cartoon writers for their unrealistic story lines; meanwhile, another Homer walks by the window in quite an unfathomable manner. Such humor is lost on some, but has been impressed on enough hearts and minds to keep people tuning in every Sunday night. Groening also dabbled in album cover art design, which can be found on the 1987 self-titled album from Crazy Backwards Alphabet. In 1993, he formed Bongo Comics, which publishes Simpsons-related Itchy & Scratchy, Radioactive Man, Lisa, and Krusty comics. He also started Zongo Comics in 1995. Books and guides giving detailed information on The Simpsons series have been published, including The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family. Games, both board and video, have also been produced involving the famous inhabitants of 742 Evergreen Terrace and Groening has also written books featuring his Life in Hell characters, including Childhood Is Hell, Love Is Hell, School Is Hell, and The Big Book of Hell. His next venture was into the future with the appropriately titled Futurama. Premiering in March 1999 and featuring the voice of Ren and Stimpy, Billy West, the sci-fi cartoon series started with the main character, Fry, delivering a pizza to a cryogenics lab. He ends up being frozen and when he wakes up in the year 3000, he's stuck marveling at the future while lamenting about his lost past with the likes of a one-eyed love interest, a robotic best friend, and a crab as a doctor. In 2000, he helped produce the animated adaptatio","vanity":"matt_groening"}}],"screenwriters":[]},"tvPosterImgUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FdTokqzWrBGZlL8tJN0dMHsYg8TE=\u002F180x270\u002Fv1.dDs1NjkxODc7ajsxODcwOTsxMjAwOzMxMDs0NjU","tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":88,"popcornState":"upright","averageRating":4.197247505187988,"numReviews":252},"tvSeries":{"id":"2210","type":"tvSeries","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":3,"freshCount":2,"rottenCount":1,"tomatometer":85,"averageScore":7.78,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"fresh","certifiedFresh":false},"tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":81,"popcornState":"upright","averageRating":4.092646598815918,"numReviews":3667},"startYear":1989,"isOngoing":true,"description":"Matt Groening's subversive, animated satire about Springfield's hapless first family became a cult favourite when it premiered on Fox in 1989 after first being seen in 1987 as a short on 'The Tracey Ullman Show.'

While the show was a phenomenon almost from the get-go (with the face of 10-year-old hell-raiser and initial breakout character Bart Simpson appearing on just about every form of merchandise imaginable), few could have predicted then that \"The Simpsons\" would become a cultural institution, running for over two decades and defining the comedic sensibilities of a generation. In the first series, the animation was noticeably cruder and some of the voice actors were still figuring out their characters (Dan Castellaneta stated that he based Homer's voice in the early going on Walter Matthau), but the show still excelled at telling small-scale stories about a lower-middle-class family trying to get by: Homer gets fired from his job at the nuclear power plant and tries to get rehired, Bart deals with a bully and Lisa befriends a jazz saxophonist who helps cure her depression. In time, \"The Simpsons\" would evolve into nothing less than an elaborate satire of every aspect of American life in the late-20th century, with jokes that ranged from highbrow literary references to humor so stupid it was almost zen; here at the very beginning, it was simply an idiosyncratic show that was equal parts hilarious and heartwarming.","heroImage":null,"seasonNumber":1,"title":"Season 1","posterImage":{"id":"t-569187","type":"Image","thumborId":"v1.dDs1NjkxODc7ajsxODcwOTsxMjAwOzMxMDs0NjU","height":465,"width":310,"format":"JPG","caption":null,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-09-25"},"endYear":1990,"network":"FOX","isEmbargoed":false,"vanityUrl":"\u002Ftv\u002Fthe_simpsons\u002Fs01","mainTrailer":null,"genre":"Animation","tvSeriesId":2210,"startDate":"1989-12-16T16:00:00-08:00"},{"id":"3806","type":"tvSeason","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":8,"freshCount":8,"rottenCount":0,"tomatometer":100,"averageScore":9,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"fresh","certifiedFresh":false},"endDate":null,"episodeCount":22,"tvRatingSummary":{"percentScore":95,"popcornState":"upright","averageRating":4.364457607269287,"numReviews":172},"startYear":1990,"description":"The second series of \"The Simpsons\" contains the very first installment of \"Treehouse of Horror,\" an episode containing a trio of terrifying short stories that would become a tradition for the show every year around Halloween.

While the show was a phenomenon almost from the get-go (with the face of 10-year-old hell-raiser and initial breakout character Bart Simpson appearing on just about every form of merchandise imaginable), few could have predicted then that \"The Simpsons\" would become a cultural institution, running for over two decades and defining the comedic sensibilities of a generation. In the first series, the animation was noticeably cruder and some of the voice actors were still figuring out their characters (Dan Castellaneta stated that he based Homer's voice in the early going on Walter Matthau), but the show still excelled at telling small-scale stories about a lower-middle-class family trying to get by: Homer gets fired from his job at the nuclear power plant and tries to get rehired, Bart deals with a bully and Lisa befriends a jazz saxophonist who helps cure her depression. In time, \"The Simpsons\" would evolve into nothing less than an elaborate satire of every aspect of American life in the late-20th century, with jokes that ranged from highbrow literary references to humor so stupid it was almost zen; here at the very beginning, it was simply an idiosyncratic show that was equal parts hilarious and heartwarming.","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","endYear":1990,"episodeCount":13,"formattedPageTitle":"The Simpsons: Season 1","genre":"Animation","imagesMeta":null,"isEmbargoed":false,"isPreRelease":false,"fullTitle":"The Simpsons: Season 1","network":"FOX","pictures":[],"posterImage":{"id":"t-569187","type":"Image","thumborId":"v1.dDs1NjkxODc7ajsxODcwOTsxMjAwOzMxMDs0NjU","height":465,"width":310,"format":"JPG","caption":null,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-09-25","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FC1PgcXLCI6CB25y42YpNCk-1hPs=\u002F206x305\u002Fv1.dDs1NjkxODc7ajsxODcwOTsxMjAwOzMxMDs0NjU"},"premiereDate":"1989-12-16T16:00:00-08:00","reviewInfo":[{"id":"77530","mediaId":3805,"mediaType":"TV Season","quote":"The citizens of Springfield deliver fresh stories, sharp barbs, and unique lessons on family, week in and week out - on a broadcast schedule, no less.","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.indiewire.com\u002F2017\u002F05\u002Fbest-animated-tv-shows-animation-simpsons-south-park-rick-morty-1201833828\u002F4\u002F","creationDate":"Jul 5, 2018","topCritic":false,"score":"fresh","isEmbargoed":false,"critic":{"id":"15401","name":"Ben Travers","mainImage":{"id":"c-2474","thumborId":"v1.YzsyNDc0O2c7MTg3MDI7MTIwMDszODs0Mg","height":42,"width":38,"format":"GIF","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fi8ZZzyruO0ecBdwpCamd9--p9gU=\u002F80x80\u002Fv1.YzsyNDc0O2c7MTg3MDI7MTIwMDszODs0Mg"},"vanity":"ben-travers","status":"CURRENT","tmApproved":true,"topCritic":true},"publication":{"id":"226","name":"indieWire","country":"us","tomatometerApproved":true,"topPublication":true,"url":"","editorialUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.indiewire.com\u002Ft\u002Freviews\u002F"},"unformattedCreationDate":"2018-07-04T17:00:00-07:00","isTop":true},{"id":"62544","mediaId":3805,"mediaType":"TV Season","quote":"...10 times funnier than The Flintstones...","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.dallasnews.com\u002Fnews\u002Ffrom-the-archives\u002F2017\u002F12\u002F18\u002Fflashback-simpsons-come-primetime-1989","creationDate":"Jan 17, 2018","topCritic":false,"score":"fresh","isEmbargoed":false,"critic":{"id":"8714","name":"Ed Bark","vanity":"ed-bark","status":"CURRENT","tmApproved":true,"topCritic":true},"publication":{"id":"490","name":"Dallas Morning News","country":"us","tomatometerApproved":true,"topPublication":true,"url":"","editorialUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.dallasnews.com\u002Fentertainment\u002Fmovies\u002Freviews\u002F"},"unformattedCreationDate":"2018-01-16T16:00:00-08:00","isTop":true},{"id":"17681","mediaId":3805,"mediaType":"TV Season","scoreOri":"A","quote":"An endless, imponderable, unstoppable Niagara of sight gags, jokes, one-liners, characters and stories that explore everything from the meaning of God to the anti-allure of Duff Beer.","url":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.newsday.com\u002Fentertainment\u002Ftv\u002Fthe-simpsons-marathon-12-days-of-magic-1.9098721","creationDate":"Aug 20, 2014","topCritic":false,"score":"fresh","isEmbargoed":false,"critic":{"id":"14506","name":"Verne Gay","vanity":"verne-gay","status":"CURRENT","tmApproved":false,"topCritic":false},"publication":{"id":"338","name":"Newsday","country":"us","tomatometerApproved":true,"topPublication":true,"url":"","editorialUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fnewsday.com\u002Fentertainment\u002Fmovies\u002F"},"unformattedCreationDate":"2014-08-19T17:00:00-07:00","isTop":true},{"id":"161536","mediaId":3805,"mediaType":"TV Season","quote":"In The Simpsons, warm and fuzzy family sitcoms are attacked with gleeful vigor.","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newspapers.com\u002Fclip\u002F68682226\u002Ftwin-peaks-season-one-the-simpsons\u002F","creationDate":"Jan 27, 2021","topCritic":false,"score":"fresh","isEmbargoed":false,"critic":{"id":"22366","name":"Debi Enker","vanity":"debi-enker","status":"CURRENT","tmApproved":false,"topCritic":false},"publication":{"id":"2041","name":"The Age (Australia)","country":"au","tomatometerApproved":true,"topPublication":true,"url":"","editorialUrl":""},"unformattedCreationDate":"2021-01-26T16:00:00-08:00","isTop":true},{"id":"74080","mediaId":3805,"mediaType":"TV Season","scoreOri":"A-","quote":"But \"Simpsons\" fans have long been more Comic Book Guy than Troy McClure - so quality be damned;

Family Guy, The Critic and Futurama.\nClever humor and writing.\nGood voice acting.\nLikable and memorable characters, especially Homer and Bart Simpson.\nEach of the family members has a very distinct personality.\nHomer is the dimwitted, but well-meaning dad.\nMarge is the strict, but loving mother.\nBart is the trouble-making son.\nLisa is the overachieving daughter.\nMaggie is the silent member of the family.\nThere are so many hilarious and unforgettable running gags.\nSideshow Bob repeatedly trying to kill Bart Simpson after the events of \"Krusty Gets Busted\".\nA different kind of couch gag at the beginning of every episode.\nHomer Simpson's famous and signature catchphrase: \"D'oh!\".\nThe way Superintendent Chalmers says \"Skinner!\".\nItchy & Scratchy, which parodies the violent cartoons of the early-to-mid 20th century.\nNelson Muntz's famous laugh.\nMemorable opening theme music, composed by Danny Elfman and arranged by Alf Clausen.\nIt's sophisticated and generous in its humor.\nGives out a lot of good morals and lessons for viewers of all ages, like \"be careful what you wish for\".\nThe episodes where The Simpsons travel around the world to other countries and other US states are great (except for \"Kill the Alligator and Run\").\nLoads of hilarious moments, funny couch gags, great stories and relatable pop-culture references like references to Dr. Seuss, South Park, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Scooby-Doo, The Beatles, Nintendo, Looney Tunes, SpongeBob SquarePants, Michael Jackson, Marvel, etc.\nThe \"Treehouse of Horror\" specials are funny, terrifying and unforgettable at the same time.\nGives us decent facts and real-life events about celebrities, politicians, etc.\nMany supporting side characters (Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, Ned Flanders, Moe Szyslak, Krusty the Clown, Milhouse van Houten, Chief Wiggum etc.)\nIt also has its share of many entertaining antagonists (Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob, Frank Grimes, Hank Scorpio, Kang and Kodos).\nThe series was so popular that it had its own film adaptation in 2007, which is also well-received.\nUnlike most FOX shows, The Simpsons takes aim at both the Democratic and Republican parties, depicting Republicans as corrupt warmongers and Democrats as brainless idiots. (and the opposite, indeed!) Not even presidents were safe from criticism, as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George H.W.
